      " while watching the show, up to the 4 episodes so far, i was strongly reminded of two stories that i've read in the past. the first and obvious one was a short story, [e for effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/e_for_effort), which is about a machine that can show the past in exact detail.  after watching all 4 episodes, i was reminded of a plot point in [the flicker men](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17910095-the-flicker-men). spoiler warning for this novel;  &#x200b;  in the flicker men, there is a machine that is kind of a super computer and its purpose is to observe all of reality. the plot point about this machine is that as long as it is turned on and observing our reality, the quantum 'wave' doesn't collapse and our reality keeps on being in a single state instead of having the wave collapse after the observer (the machine) has finished observing it, so the protagonists of the story can move forward with their attempts (spoiler) to save their simulated reality.  &#x200b;  so maybe the machine in this show, in devs, is also continuously observing our reality, and preventing the collapse of the wave function. the 4th episode introduced the multiverse theory with practical applications (clearing up the visual and audio from past and future projections), showing possible pasts and futures, different timelines according to different possible choices.  so, as long as the machine remains turned on, their reality can only move forward in one way, one timeline, a fixed, deterministic timeline, with fixed causes and effects. and maybe, if the machine is turned off, then the fixed nature of time is ended, and the observer effect comes into play and humans can make choices that will change the future, despite whatever the machine predicted before.  &#x200b;  i'm really interested to see how the plot evolves in the remaining episodes. will they attempt to turn of the machine to end its observer effect on their entire reality and regain free choice? or am i completely off base with everything i've said here. either way, i'm really looking forward to the next episode.\n",

      " one thing that took me off from episode 4 was that the actress who played lyndon was obviously a girl. i thought that perhaps that was going to be important to the plot but then i found that she was cast because on the words of garland:  > garland wanted lyndon to look very young, but didn't want to cast a  child actor both for reasons involving the restrictions that would place  on production and because he wanted the maturity an older performer  would bring to the character. (spaeny turns 23 in july.) \"with lyndon,  sort of as i'm flicking through actors' photos and resumes, i was just  thinking, nope, nope, nope, and then got the idea of casting a girl to  play a boy, and then met cailee,\" he explains. \"even before she started  reading, i thought, *oh, that's her.* like, *this actress is going to be perfect for playing this boy.* and then i never met anyone else.\"   [https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/alex-garland-interview-devs](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/alex-garland-interview-devs)  this kind of bother me. not that a girl is playing lyndon but that it is absolutely unnecessary. why couldn't lyndon just be lynda and  a female engineering prodigy  instead of a boy? after all, with the exception katie, all the devs' people were male.    in my opinion garland, at least in this particular show, is a bit pretentious, more form than substance.\n",

      " this is just an idea i had, it really has now grounding but i still think it's interesting and want to share to maybe get others thinking haha  so the show digs into some things but leaves others to question, at least for me. maybe i missed some things. i don't understand why forest has a giant statue of his daughter, or why she's holding her hands up as if she's holding something, or where his wife is, or why sergei tried to leak dev's plans or what those plans even were.  so my theory is, forest is not only mourning the loss of his daughter, but his wife. where is she? what happened? did i miss it? i'm also considering that he has a part of his wife's consciousness yet, or his daughter's. he's fixated on projecting within their own universe/timeline and i think he wants to bring back his actual wife or daughter, or travel back to them, if they can't travel to him.  i think he might have plans for the statue as well, to bring it to life in some form. if not the statue, then something else, or someone. his daughter is holding her hands up, as if holding something. i still don't understand that. it'd be cool if she held a portal open and a helicopter flew into it.   and i think lily may have a role in helping him at some point, whether she wants to or not. forest seems like a lost person, he already has murder on his hands, but whatever he's working on at dev's is for the better of the world i believe. i find this to be possible because the employees enjoy their work and when lyndon was fired, it hurt him and the others. i also think lyndon is the one who will die as the projection showed, not lilly. it could also be a projection from outside of their universe/timeline, thus meaning that lily or someone else could die, but not in their world.   lily's boyfriend was a spy too and she didn't know. and maybe lyndon can help lily with stopping devs, or completing what they've started. i really don't know haha  the projections are another thing i don't understand. my theory is they are from the point of view of mothers. mary watching/hearing jesus. his wife watching/hearing their daughter. that wouldn't explain the marilyn monroe bit though. i guess the only other idea i have is that dev's is somehow tapping into the very fabric of the universe, but i don't understand why. maybe to rip a whole in it, and go through the hole. someone on here said that dev's may mean deviation, not development. so maybe their trying to find a deviation in their universe, which could just be code if they're in a simulation. i don't know!  what is clear to me though, is that dev's is trying to avoid getting caught for murder, lily is trying to prove that murder, and forest misses his daughter. that's all i got!  i like this show and i know garland likes twists, so i'm excited to see what unexpected turns are to come despite half of the dialogue going over my head lol\n",

(here, i have to apologize because i previously referred to causal determinism as “scientific determinism”, but “scientific determinism” is actually an obsolete term for hard determinism.) in hard determinism, katie can’t leave the lecture hall in eight different directions. a myriad of factors—including the weather, her dna, the evenness of the stairs—all act as walls creating a single path.  hard determinism claims that only one outcome is possible. a billion tiny factors come into play and their combination is what happens, the only thing that happens, the only thing that can happen. free will is an illusion.  this is the thing to remember: hard determinism is a moral philosophy, not a scientific construct for interpreting results. hard determinism argues that murderers are not morally culpable because a billion tiny factors conspired to make them commit murder.  morality 101: there is no good or evil without choice. hard determinism claims that choice is an illusion and forest is “innocent”.  what causal and hard determinism have in common is the belief that outcomes always and only happen because of pre-existing forces. causal determinism factors free will in as part of the equation, thus allowing for multiple universes where different choices were made. hard determinism holds that free will does not exist.  this is why multiverse theory—despite being deterministic—is incompatible with philosophical determinism. the multiverse is real and forest is guilty, or the universe is on rails and he is innocent.\n",

      " r/randonauts are a group of people using a quantum random number generator to create truly random locations on your phone’s gps. the creators of the community believe that by traveling to these truly random locations, they are able to walk away from their predetermined path, or break out of the deterministic nature of the universe, and explore other probable timelines. it sounds crazy but i’ve been a randonaut for a long time and have experienced many strange coincidences while randonauting. because i’ve been a randonaut for a while, when i first started watching this show and heard all the references to the many worlds theory, quantum mechanics, and determinism, i kinda had a moment 😅 it’s one of those things where you can’t really tell if art is mimicking reality or vice versa. ironically, the development team also calls themselves devs and a few of them are from russia. maybe that’s not that strange of a coincidence but i digress, i just thought i’d share. i feel like many of the people watching this show would really get a kick out of this.\n",

      " remember the scene were sergei views the code for the first time and throws up afterwards.  he was gripped by existential dread.  he says \"if true, this changes everything\", then katie says \"no, actually it changes nothing, that is the point of it\".  a clue is given in the latest episode in the part of the various theories on the double slit experiment, where the outcome is changed when observed, one of the theories states that the act of the human conscience observing something, changes it. katie calls that theory crap, in favor of a multiverse deterministic theory.  so that's what it's about i think.  sergei sees that they're trying to \"observe\" particles in the past, which according to one quantum theory would change the outcome, thus possible changing the past and thereby changing the future. that's why he gets sick. he realizes they're potentially playing god, trying to change the past.  katie on the other hand believes in a multiverse deterministic model of quantum physics, in which observing a phenomenon doesn't change it, merely reflects a different branch of an infinite multiverse of possibilities.  so the underlying motive here is, forrester might be trying to change the past, by observing it, just like observing the dual slit experiment changes the outcome.  now, this series is about quantum physics, and we should understand that the one theory that katie calls \"crap\" is a sort of \"magical thinking\", that some consider pseudo-science and others consider quite possible.  the series uses this as its base for the age old questions of free will vs fate. there's a strong underlying religious motive here as well with the many references to jesus and the cross. the quatum computer also looks like a cross, the cross that forrester (wordplay to jesus as carpenter?) has chosen to die or has he? did jesus really know he would die on the cross or did he have a choice.\n",

      " from what i understand there are three theories about how it works:  a deterministic many worlds model, where each possible outcome becomes realized in their own world. (there are of course different variations of the many worlds scenario, but only this includes the double slit experiment as far as i know)  wave function collapse. all the possibilities are reduced to just a single one, and the other just cease to exist. because randomness is involved, the world is not fully deterministic.  pilot waves. unlike the two previous examples, each particle never branch into several different possibilities, but remains a single unit all the way. it rides on waves of a kind that is assumed to exist, but which has never been detected or measured. this is also a deterministic world.  as mentioned in another post, i don't like the idea that it is the measurement itself that destroys the wave properties of the experiment if we assume it is the wave collapse theory that is correct. for a detector to work something has to trigger it. it's just like a camera; to be able to take picture of something you need light that reacts with chemicals on the film (or the modern day digital counterpart). which can only happen when energy is transferred. for energy to be transferred from a particle to the detector, it has to happen exactly where the detector is. when energy transfer takes place, all the other possibly routes cease to exist.  it's like a lottery; all the people who have bought a ticket are potential winners. nobody has lost of won yet. but when a number is picked up from the hat, all the potential winners are reduced to just one.  everything that happens in the universe is about transferring energy. each transfer produce information, and like energy, information doesn't go away. devs seems to have found a way to read the information left behind.  what happens on macro scale, defined by emergent properties, is not affected much by what happens on quantum level. no matter how many different timelines we have, not many will show us one where the moon is closer or further away from the earth, or that a planet in the solar system is missing.  life is defined as dissipative structures, controlled butterflyeffects inside a system, where access to energy makes phenomena that happens in a microscale affect what happens on higher levels in the form of a living organism. which is what creates paradoxes. a monitor showing the future on a dead planet in a dead universe would not create a paradox because there wouldn't be anyone around to act on the information available on the screen. a living intelligent beings on the other hand, could make use of that information (semiotics) to create a paradox.\n",

      " so i was thinking for a while about the events that led to sergey’s death, and what role forrest’s prediction system played in them. it’s not 100% certain that they used the system to predict his betrayal - they could’ve also noticed he was recording the code through conventional surveillance - but it’s strongly implied they did. when forrest confronts sergey on his way out, his speech clearly points to it; he’s also aware of details like the wristwatch, and lastly kenton hides himself in the exact position from where he could quickly tackle sergey.   that made me wonder about two things: if they could perfectly predict sergey’s betrayal and all the consequences it brought, why did they choose this way of dealing with it? and what does this tell us about the nature of the system they’re using? starting with the second one, there are a couple different options, and each also has different implications for the first.  the most obvious and common sense approach is to treat all predictions as probabilistic and dependent on key assumptions. the system shows you the outcome of a trend you specified, e.g. \"what would happen if i hired sergey for devs?\", giving you the chance to avoid it. but that is at odds with forrest’s extreme determinism and the actions he takes as a result. he believes that there is only one path towards a single predetermined outcome, the synapses in your brain are wired in one specific way that leads directly from a stimulus to a response, and free will is just a comforting illusion your mind spins for itself. so he would not have built the system in such a way, or made a query that is even slightly indeterminate.   that, however, raises the logical problem of how predictions could be simultaneously perfectly accurate and self-defeating. katie and forrest were briefly talking about this in the viewing room, but forrest shied away from doing the experiment by looking a few seconds into their own future, presumably because it threatens his worldview. with sergey, it is also clearly in forrest’s power to avoid the path he’s just been shown, he just insists on sticking with it because doing otherwise would mean admitting that he has a choice - and that he had one in the death of his family.  the only way around this is to assume that the prediction system is so good that it can even account for the impact of its own forecast (probably creating an infinite recursion like in the grandfather paradox, but let’s drop this for now). the prediction itself is just another stimulus that enters the actor’s brain and guides their response in a way that is itself predictable. so it shows forrest a vision of sergey’s betrayal and murder, accounting for the fact that his rigid determinism will force him to keep to this exact path.   which creates another issue, because then the forecast would change depending on who watches it. kenton, who likes to contain problems as early as possible, would certainly have preferred to avoid all the subsequent trouble and simply have sergey fail his background check. so if he’d been the one to query the system, it would probably have shown him something like sergey being arrested, or telling his handler that he’s been fired from amaya. so again, we’re left with multiple possible outcomes, coming down to the choice of who was using the system. at the point where forrest decided to take care of it personally, sergey’s fate may have been sealed, but he must be aware that there would’ve been other options.  any thoughts on this? there are a couple hints that although the system is a brainchild of forrest’s philosophy, its results will eventually undermine it. a failed prediction, or perhaps a prediction that turns out to be wrong because it depended on the subjective perspective of the person who watched it, would be a good candidate for that. right now, everybody at amaya seems to believe that lily is doomed to die soon, and that this event has a seminal importance for the world. that might also be the point where forrest’s \"trial\" is ultimately resolved, and probably (hah!) not to his benefit.\n",

      " i’ve been thinking about the multiverse theory and the way it’s being discussed on the show, and here’s my take on it. the way the seem to discuss the multiverse theory, it seems like something that is all about our perception, that we “choose” to perceive this reality rather than the other, and i don’t think that’s the case. i believe in the multiverse theory in a way that each universe is very much real and physical, and driven by an actual choice, not perception alone and that each person’s path in the multiverse is non-deterministic but the multiverse as a whole is deterministic, in other words, the universe is deterministic because everything that can happen will happen, there’s a path for every possible combination of causes and effects and decisions, so when your perform a set of actions in a certain way in a certain moment, affected by the trillions of other factors such as who walked by, the weather, someone played a loud sound, someone dropped a rock that someone else didn’t see and tripped and fell, someone you’re about to meet came on time or early or late or things as old as your childhood...etc. all those will lead you to follow a certain path in a certain universe, while in another universe, there’s a version of you that did things either slightly or significantly different and life turned up differently for them.  so yes, you have a choice, you were affected by the world in a certain way, all your life and you made choices accordingly and it has led to this point, a moment that is a product of you and everyone and everything around you, both by choice and chance, while another you in another physical universe had it differently.  so free will choice does exist in a multiverse, and it is not just a matter of the brain choosing to see one or the other, but rather there being an infinite number of universes in the multiverse, each of which features a version of everyone and everything whose life turned up some way. however, we call the multiverse deterministic because the choices are all written, written not as in forced upon us, but because they encompass everything that can possible happen and everything that anyone can choose.\n",

      " has it occurred to anyone else that this piece is starting to feel like a strange mirror-image of *ex machina?*  the more i get those vibes, the more i think they may provide a hint to where this is all heading ...  in that movie (garland's debut), the narcissist tech ”god” nathan purposely isolated himself in his own little frankenstein’s castle on this huge wilderness estate and became obsessed with creating an ai by figuring out and then modeling “how people think” so he could build something w/ its own “free will.”  to do that, he had to build a machine that was truly “random“ or “chaotic” enough to think like a human — making him god by escaping its own “**black and white room**” and walking out into the world of the real.  in *devs,* the would-be gods don’t give a damn “how people think.”  they don’t even think they *do* think, really.  and they definitely don’t buy into free will.  it’s all determined by the “tram line” rules of the quantum physical landscape — and it‘s that pre-structured world *outside of* and around each human conscience that they want to model well enough to make themselves “**deus**. “ they’ll know they‘ve achieved it when ... what?  what’s their “turing test” for this thing??  one interesting irony is that — in another flip-side to *ex machina*’s nathan — we know that while these two may not care ”how people think,\" they do care about people.   in fact, forest is almost *frozen* by his all-consuming love for a lost daughter.  instead of a sprawling alaskan estate and crazy mansion-lab, he lives in the same little suburban house he did before he got rich — he even has the same 2000s-ish subaru (his daughter’s carseat prob still in it).  and katie too, while harder to read, is seen crying real tears while watching forest’s daughter on the screen — an even more vivid sign that she has real empathy for human beings somewhere under that cold veneer.  lily appears to be their ”ava” on some level — something they want to both control and see control *herself* (almost like a parent-child relationship).  but like i said, they‘re not trying to build a mary to walk out of the “black and white room.”  weirdly, they seem to just want to build that *black and white room itself.*  at different times, we even see members of the devs team building their own little black-and-white ”rooms” on-screen, staring vacantly at blurry versions of joan of arc burning or marilyn monroe banging w/ the same voyeuristic nonchalance you might have watched the paris hilton sex tape on some early version of youtube (not that any of us did that).  it’s as if they were looking right out of their own windows and into the rooms of neighbors that already, *actually* existed — just across the street.  **so here’s my dumb theory**.  i feel like forest’s ultimate goal is to model the universe w/ this quantum computer to such an extent that he can actually cross that street and enter one of these rooms instead of just peer at it.  uploading his own consciousness into a quantum computer w/ enough juice, he seems to think, is something different than creating a ”simulation” for people to enjoy.  if he can enter a version of the universe where his daughter didn’t die — but a version as it is instead of what it “would be” — then he can be in the same place with his daughter’s actual *soul.*  that’s why he doesn’t want “many worlds” or other ones or new ones — he wants to collapse whatever versions there are into a real one that has both he amaya in it.  and i think lily is somehow the control for this “collapsing” experiment — someone they *know* is supposed to die in a certain way but whose fate they can screw with such that they can tell which ”room“ they are standing in.  in this looking-glass version of *ex machina*, their turing test isn’t to create something that can escape the ”black and white room“ and thereby become its own conscious, color-seeing being.  they just want to create a room w/ enough color that human beings can walk into it — and still feel like they took their souls in with them.\n",

(excerpt from the article)**authoritarianism and big data**  for the korean thinker, citizens of countries like taiwan, japan or singapore, with a more **authoritarian cultural tradition and mentality**, trust the state much more, **are more obedient and collectivist**; above all, they believe in **digital surveillance** and the use of metadata to defend themselves from the pandemic.  \"in asia, one could say that epidemics are not only fought by virologists and epidemiologists but above all by computer scientists and macro-data specialists. this is a paradigm shift that europe has not yet realized. apologists for digital surveillance would proclaim that big data saves human lives,\" says chul han.  in china, for example, there are 200 million surveillance **cameras with facial recognition** that watch its citizens at all times in their public life. but they have also achieved something unthinkable in other privacy-friendly countries, where their citizens not only submit to corporate and government control through their own social networks but also watch over each other.  >*\"it would be more sensible to decree a ban on europeans leaving, to protect the world from europe\"*  \"in the vocabulary of the chinese,\" says the philosopher, \"the term **'private sphere'** does not appear,\" which has facilitated the construction of a whole infrastructure for surveillance that is highly effective in **containing** an epidemic:  \"when someone leaves the beijing station he is automatically captured by a camera that measures his body temperature. if the temperature is of concern, all the people sitting in the same car are notified on their mobile phones.\"   there are also drones that fly over the streets stopping anyone who breaks [quarantine](https://aldianews.com/es/articles/politics/la-tercera-parte-de-colombia-hace-simulacro-de-cuarentena/57962).   something similar occurs in korea, where, in addition to the famous crown-app, there are cameras in the buildings and a group of professionals called \"trackers\" who watch the video footage to follow those infected and the people with whom they have come into contact.  a society that may seem dystopian to many, but which has shown how it is no longer the sovereign who \"absurdly\" closes its borders, but the one who has the data.  or masks. those that are **used specifically for the coronavirus** in countries like korea, which filter the air and even the prime minister wears them in his appearances. masks and factories that are built to supply them.   while in the west the effectiveness of the masks is questioned or they are requisitioned as it happens in france because it is no longer possible to find them\n",

      " so i think most of us can agree that the ultimate goal of the devs project, and by extension forest's ultimate goal, is most likely gonna be reviving amaya somehow. it's the \"somehow\" that's the wild card, but i think i have a pretty good guess as to how forest plans to achieve this goal and why. before we get to that however, i'd like to offer my theories on how exactly the machine works, which is necessary in order to understand what it's capable of and what forest ultimately plans to do with it.  the quantum computer works because of causality. basically, it uses causality to calculate how an event happened or how an object got to its current state using quantum data from the particles that compose the object or location, and through these calculations it can create projections of the past by extrapolating further and further back up the chain of causality. the scanning machine was a test of the computer's capability to analyze matter and extrapolate the matter's previous state from its quantum data. in the episode 5 flashback they tested this by extrapolating the rat's data and displaying the moments before it died. the experiment seemed to be a success, but i'm not so certain that they merely wanted to see the rat before it died on a screen. if anything, it seems to me like that scene is hinting that the machine could somehow revive the rat.  here's how i think it might do it: if the machine can analyze matter down to its elementary particles and then calculate those particles' previous quantum states, it's possible that the machine can reverse the particles back to that state as well. if it were to do that for every particle in the rat's corpse, then it might be able to revive it. but the machine isn't just extrapolating the rat. it's extrapolating the room, it's extrapolating forest himself. it's extending it's range of extrapolation to the particles all around it. now, if the machine is capable of creating projections of jesus, joan of arc, and lincoln, then doesn't that imply that the machine has reached a point where it's range of extrapolation is global? as in, it could potentially analyze every particle on earth, extrapolate its previous quantum states, and then reverse it?   do you see where this is going? forest doesn't just want to bring back amaya. he wants to go back in time.   the implications of the machine reversing time are enormous, to say the least. assuming forest only created devs in the timeline that amaya died, if amaya survives the crash or if the crash never happens then this obviously creates a pretty huge paradox. forest probably accounted for this, and *this* is the reason why devs is isolated from the rest of the world, so that it could survive the reversal and thus prevent a paradox. however, if the everett interpretation is real, then that creates a much bigger problem for forest: the possibility that going back and saving amaya would simply create another branch in the timeline, and he'd still be stuck in the timeline where amaya died. he would've saved another amaya, not his, and this is why he loathes the everett interpretation.  but why go through all these lengths? wouldn't it be easier to dig up amaya's bones, assuming there is a grave, and extrapolate the corpse back to a point right before amaya died? that seems a bit too morbid, even for forest. i think it has to do with forest's personal quest for absolution. it's not just about bringing her back, its about proving to himself that he wasn't responsible for her death. he is dead set on proving that his tramlines are right and that everett is wrong. this might seem like he is trying to sate his ego as a scientist, but his devotion to his tramlines isn't scientific, it is borderline religious. in fact it is religious, because his rejection of the everett interpretation is rooted in denial.  under de broglie-bohm, forest can convince himself that everything he has done was inevitable as dictated by determinism. amaya was always going to die, he was always going to create devs, and he was always going to reverse time. it's tramlines all the way down.  everett being right would prove that he caused amaya's death, and everything he had done would have been for nothing. all of his sins, from amaya's death to murdering sergei and playing god, would be squarely on him. it's a horrifying realization and one that he's absolutely terrified of because deep down he knows it's the truth. even so, he's going to go through with this insane plan anyways, because forest isn't driven by scientific curiosity, or a desire for fame and glory, and he certainly doesn't care about becoming a god. forest only cares about two things: being with his daughter again, and absolving himself of his guilt over her death. and he is dead set on achieving both goals, no matter the cost.\n",

(kind of them to explain this one.)  cut to a view of the clean room, with six long tubes like robot arms are arrayed from the ceiling pointed at the items, each at a corner of the hexagonal table.  a man in white ppe enters, and places a dead mouse at the center of the table, then exits.  forrest stands at the clean room window staring at the table; behind him the devs team are typing at workstations.  the light in the clean room shifts to red, blue and green, spinning around the room.    on a workstation a grainy clock appears.  another shows a flower, and then zooms in to show a microscopic view.   stewart: whoa, this is way better than last time.  my sugar cube doesn't have a single error package.                              lyndon: got a few here in the shell.                                katie: are those errors?  i think those are actual gaps in the structure.                              l:  oh.  yeah, you might be right.                              k:  skull is good too.                                s:  i'm now at 1.2 times 10 to the power of 18.  still clean.  i mean, look at these sucrose molecules.  my sugar is sweet!                              l:  i think the mouse is sweet.                              s:  the mouse is *dead*.                              l:  still sweet.  he's got a cute little face.                              k:  forrest, i think we're good, we can try to extrapolate inwards.                              forrest: cool.  so do it.   k: okay.  let's see.  machinery hums; on a screen opposite the clean room, the table's surface comes into grainy view, dead mouse at the center.     f:  silence from the team.  so it worked?  k:  yeah.  it worked.    f:  keep going.  k:  keep extrapolating?  you mean outwards?  f: why not.  l:  we'll run out of memory pretty fuckin' quick, but yeah.  why not.  no harm it could do.  **the rest of the clean room is slowly replicated onscreen, complete with forrest's staring face.**    ***epilogue:***  forrest and katie are at a workstation near the clean room.  on the screen is a fuzzy image of the dead mouse.  f:  do you think any of them understand what we're really doing here?  k:  i'm not sure.  i'm not sure you even understand what we're really doing here.  f:  what do you mean?  k:  **i think devs is how you've put yourself on trial.  it's judge and jury.  if it works, determinism precludes free will, and you're absolved, and did no wrong.  but if it doesn't work, you had choices, and you're guilty.**    f:  if it doesn't work i'm damned.  k:  yes, pretty much.  what's my place in this trial?  f:  you're a witness.  k:  no.  i'm the lawyer for the defense.  i'm gonna make my opening argument.  are you ready?  f:  uhm, no.... yeah.  katie presses a button.  the mouse breathes, twitches, stretches, **gets up and moves.**  (on rewatch this is not backwards -- it really looks as if it had been sleeping, takes a deep breath and wakes up.)   but the camera draws back through the clean room showing the real mouse on the table, still dead.    ----  even after watching it twice i do not understand what's happening here or how it relates to what we see the project become.  (which, as far as my stoopid brane can comprehend, is a view through time.)  * when is this experiment occurring?  *sometime before now, as lyndon is present.*    * what exactly is the machine doing here?  *whatever they were trying to do, it worked, but what were they trying to do?*    * what is happening with the dead mouse getting up and living again?  *is it predicting resurrection?*   * what is extrapolation in this context?  *what's the difference between extrapolating inwards, versus outwards?*  * what is the connection between this experiment and what we've already seen the machine do (e.g., show christ on the cross)?  edit: so my transcription has me thinking.  if the project works -- whatever the project is -- then life is preordained, and the choices we think we are making were always going to be made that way.\n",

      " *devs* is presenting us with two very ominous facts about our lovely-but-strange protagonist lily right now: (1) she lives in a deterministic world where her path in life is a pre-ordained, unalterable route, and (2) that route appears to end in a death that‘s already being watched by her employers on a semi-regular basis — as if her life was some nutty show on hulu they were getting hooked on.  but do we know for sure that’s lily whose death we’re seeing on the devs screen?  because it feels a little suspicious that we only see “lily” from a distance — first only from behind, and then in ep. 5 from high above and in darkness ... especially where the other devs “videos” usually show what’s going on from a more direct, frontal vantage point.  it makes me wonder if we might not be seeing some case of “mistaken identity” where maybe someone else is actually the one who is dying in the futute ... someone who looks a lot like lily from behind or far away in the dark — and maybe has a reason to sacrifice himself to save her.  under the **debrogille-bohm single universe theory** that forest is so dead-set on, i think we’re supposed to understand that because forest and katie saw ”lily” die in the way she did, there’s no other thing that could happen and still satisfy determinism.  in other words, if lily or someone else were to find out about this and try to avoid her death, such an act could “break the world” by reversing the cause-and-effect order of things.  but is there not some cosmic “wiggle-room“ here because of the way they saw the future — specifically the fact that they didn’t really see her face?  hypothetically, let’s say that someone who was totally committed to lily learned that she was in danger of losing her life and tried to intervene.  let’s say that person had a similar slight build, short black haircut — essentially looked the same from the back (and from a ceiling view).  if such a person — in an act of what would end up being self-sacrifice — took the place of lily in the same scene and under the same circumstances as we see her “die” in the “flash-forward” on the devs screen, could such a person ultimately “step into” lily‘s cosmic shoes in a way that satisfies determinism?   could we be seeing someone else dying — and not lily?  because if so, i think i have the perfect candidate.   could it be that:  &#x200b;  **puppy dog ex bf jamie = lily on the devs video???**  &#x200b;  maybe he’s not quite as slight-of-build as she is ... and he‘d have to shave the beard ... but i get the impression that they’re trying to make it look that way a little bit in the way certain scenes are shot.  (go back and look at like the bar scene for instance:)  &#x200b;  [mirror image \\(minus the beard\\)?](https://preview.redd.it/li7m4ryuazp41.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0ac1a8cbaac62f61380619cc311590f15d8f167)  and then theres other clues being dropped.  like the casting of a female actress to play a male (lyndon).   the setting up of jamie as the character who would “do anything for lily.”  the growing dread about what might happen if people didn’t let the future play out as it was determined ...  one way to look at it — to take this craziness to the next level —  is that when we see this devs video of “lily’s” death, what we’re really watching is a **schroedinger’s cat** type situation — an ambiguous situation where both lily and her would-be savior jamie are both dying “at the same time” in the past, with the specific identity of the death only being resolved for those who “open the box” and observe the actual event in the future??  not showing the victim’s face, in this sense, is like the cat being “in the box” — a “superposition” of two possible events that might happen.  in a way, jamie ”filling in” for lily would also be like a satisfaction of the [nabikov self-consistency principle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/novikov_self-consistency_principle) — the debrogille-bohm universe would survive intact because the sacrificial lamb jamie ( ”pretending” to be lily) would be the death that the devs people were watching all along!  he might be doing this both to save lily, and save the universe from whatever would happen if someone tried to change an event they knew was supposed to happen and sent the trams flying off their rails.  &#x200b;  a nutty theory, i realize.  but if we see jamie shaving his beard at some point, we might have reason to get suspicious ...\n",

      " *(\\* edit — as someone pointed out, the dialogue needed to be fixed below)*     i re-watched part of episode 2 the other day and something really jumped out at me that i think reveals something disturbing about the universe and main characters of *devs.*  it cast the whole show in a different light for me — especially forest and kate.  it’s the scene where forest and kenton are sitting on his porch and talking ... in what seems like an off-hand remark, kenton says something about how forest should get a new car.  “think about the environment,” he says.  “i don’t think about the environment,” forest says.  and then he kinda ... stares at him.  you have to go back and watch offerman’s performance to see what i mean — he does a lot with his eyes in this.  combine it with other (otherwise inexplicable) pieces of dialogue from the series ... like the scene where katie and forest are talking about how essentially committing murder “shouldn’t be this difficult” given some sort of circumstance ( — what??).  or the side-eye stewart later gives katie when he slyly accuses her of knowing something about the future that they don’t, and the way she shuts him down.  i think the implication here — and it might not even be that subtle — is that forest and katie have seen **the end of the world** in the not-too-distant future.  something completely destructive.  that’s why he ”doesn’t think about the environment.“  and it certainly explains why he doesn’t care about money, etc.  i also think that existential realization is at the root of the deep depression we see in forest’s eyes — mixed up with and masked by the grief over his daughter, of course — as well as katie’s sort-of calm and clear-eyed coldness toward everything.  maybe this machine is now all about trying to prevent whatever apocalypse they saw?  or maybe they’re trying to essentially **store all the data that makes up human civilization and history to preserve it past the destruction of man?**  or maybe — perhaps the most depressing possibility — forest sees the meaningless of everything else and is just trying to spend a little more time with his daughter before it’s all over.  &#x200b;  .. maybe this isn’t necessarily the best series for us to be watching in these times of woe.  (but i have a feeling that’s not gonna stop anyone of us from watching the hell out of it.)\n",

      " if the world of *devs* is a simulation, as many on this board believe (and have started to convince me), then we might want to consider which of these characters can be assumed to be “**sim**” minds — the little characters walking around in *grand theft auto* that one might murder or carjack without a second thought — and which characters might represent “**players**.”  by “players“ i’m referring to the possibility that in addition to the “sims,” we might have avatars here that represent the biological minds of whatever species created the simulation and may be entering it to experience it (like a *gta* video game).  and we might want to consider that such “players” — if fully committed to experiencing the simulation — **don’t know what they are**.  (kinda like neo in *the matrix.)*  because if any of that’s true, i have an idea.  maybe forest and katie — having realized this was a simulation and examined the code — found someone in their orbit whose code does not appear to follow a set, determined path — **a magician without “tram lines“** — who may therefore represent a “player.”  maybe forest and katie have been playing this whole long game at devs in order to lure this “player” in, slowly bring about their consciousness of what the sim world is, and get some answers about what’s going on in the “real” level above them.   maybe forest sees this as a pathway through which he can ultimately “reset” or re-enter the simulation where his daughter is still alive.  maybe he thinks he can “**meet his makers”** ... if only he can track down this person and “wake them up“ to (non) reality.  &#x200b;  .. **and maybe it‘s lily**.  &#x200b;    &#x200b;\n",

(it’s not about the difficulties of threesomes, pervs — i’ve posted extensively about that elsewhere.  just kidding ... but i should.)  this happens because with two bodies, you can use closed-form mathematical expressions — your algebraic equations, integrals.  but when you add that third bastard, you just can’t ... the system becomes “**chaotic**” and you end up needing some **jeff goldblum**\\-type dude to pour water all over your hand just to explain [the basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-mpiftipv4).  [this](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2239097-even-a-computer-the-size-of-the-universe-cant-predict-everything/) is an interesting recent article on point (titled “***even a computer the size of a universe can’t predict everything***”) — it’s about an experiment done at a university in portugal involving computer simulations of three-body problems (black holes, in this case).  they determined the extent of the system’s unpredictability based on how impossible it was to ”rewind” these sims back to their initial configuration. **\\*\\***  it really is worth reading if you’re interested.  but the basics are that:  >*“fundamental limits on the smallest possible lengths of time and space mean that some events obeying basic laws of physics can never be predicted ...* ***even with the most powerful computer simulations.****”*  as interesting as this math is, though, it’s also a principle that anyone who‘s ever been caught in a love triangle understands intuitively.  ”two-body” relationships, as we know, are complicated enough — but throw in that third element and no portuguese scientist or supercomputer on earth is gonna be able to predict the consequences.   (i call this the [tiger woods-bimbo-beatdown theory](https://nypost.com/2013/11/24/the-night-tiger-woods-was-exposed-as-a-serial-cheater/).)   just think what happened when caleb entered the equation in *ex machina*, for instance.  i feel like garland has been working that same human metaphor in *devs*.  **sergei,** for instance, hangs over everything in the **lily-jamie** relationship — *even though he’s dead*.  he’s seemingly made jamie’s re-involvement in lily’s life complicated at every step (or ”**transcendently weird**,” in j’s words).  we even see them wandering the same room like a love triangle of entangled ghosts.  if they were bodies in space, he’d be that 3rd star that’s collapsed into a black hole — impossible to “see,“ but still meddling gravitationally in the affairs of the celestial living.  **so finally to my point**.  i think that quick-cut we saw to kenton in this episode 6 was a huge red flag that the best laid plans of our mice-resurrecting scientists are about to go very astray in our 3rd act.  i think kenton’s involvement at this point — especially since he’s been kept on the periphery — could represent a **3rd** **body** that will take events off the predictable tram tracks that forest and katie think they have them on.  in fact, i think kenton’s whole involvement in this affair could be the wild card that’s creating all the “static“ in the devs future projection.  computers, after all — **even ones the size of the universe —** just can’t predict such things ... at least if portuguese scientists are to be believed. (and have they ever steered us wrong?)  right now f&k are orbiting the **lily-jamie mass-point**, and they seem pretty content in a mutual belief that their plan — whatever it is — is on track.  but maybe forest was *sincere* when he said he didn’t quite know the extent of what kenton had done with jamie.  is it even plausible that they weren’t monitoring such events with devs, though?  did he lie?  if not, i really think forest should have mentioned the broken hand to katie.  maybe as the smarter of the pair, she’d have recognized if an “unpredictability” of this kind was the calling card of our “**three-body problem**“ ... and the reason they can’t see forward.  as it is, however, they might be flying blind into a snowstorm of **chaos-theory static.**  maybe kenton is the reason that something goes wrong at the devs facility, as some are predicting.  or maybe someone else, like wise-man *stewart* or young-blood *lyndon* will prove to be the unmodelable \"third body\" bad boy that shows up unexpectedly in the third act and impacts something that renders the future \"unseeable\" from that point forward. but however you lean, i think it’s fair to say that the next 21 hours in the *devs* world are going to be pretty unpredictable.  for that, we certainly have garland’s writing to thank — and maybe the existence of the three-body problem.   for as that [linked article](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2239097-even-a-computer-the-size-of-the-universe-cant-predict-everything/) shows scientifically when it comes to computer projections, having three “bodies“ like this can cause ... well, ***problems***.  &#x200b;  **——————————————————————————————————————**  **\\*\\* added note**: *a few commentators have pointed out that the situation in* devs *may be significantly different from the one described by the linked article (which does not specifically mention* ***quantum*** *computers).*  ***is that true?***  *i trust pretty much everybody’s opinion over mine, but i‘d also be interested to come across any info that could confirm this either way ... i’m just personally fascinated by the experiment these scientists describe and the questions it raises about the ultimate limits that nature imposes on such simulations — so of course i’m curious to learn how quantum computers like the one we see in* devs *might change things.*  my own understanding as a lay person was that quantum computers — like any “***universe-sized” computer*** *— could still run into the kind of*  ***3-body problems*** *that are* *described in the article because of the impact that immeasurably-small “sub-planck-length” factors can have on the ultimate behavior of “chaotic“ systems.  as the full paper on the experiment describes (published just weeks ago and* [available here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04029.pdf)*!), this is an issue that ”****brute computer power****” simply cannot address — even if such a computer had an infinity of time in which to do calculations.*  *in other words, it’s not an issue of how much there is to calculate, or how many calculations are required — “it’s an issue of ”****smallness****.”  if there are some “causes” in nature that simply cannot be measured by any computer because they fall below the planck length — but which may nonetheless have an “effect” over time on what we see these systems actually* ***do*** *— than we might just have to accept that the* ***arrow of time*** *is truly ”irreversible“ in some situations in the sense that they cannot be predicted w/ total accuracy.  this might therefore represent an ultimate limit to how “real” our simulations can ever really be as models of the universe, and an uncrossable barrier to mathematical prediction that even quantum computers cannot help us tear down.*  *at this point, we probably can’t expect that the 3-body problem itself will really play a role in * devs *as anything more than a metaphor or science-y “easter egg” that garland is pointing to obliquely; a stand-in, maybe, for whatever wall forest and katie‘s hubris is going to slam into.  but we can expect the limits of these simulations in the “real world“ to remain a focus of debate long after the season finale ... and i’d personally be interested to learn — if anyone has info or opinions — whether quantum computing technology actually does change where this barrier lies.*  ***thanks for reading!***\n",

      " [many words?](https://youtu.be/knwkpfokipk)  the big reveal from episode 6 was the possible end of the universe as a result of the \"break down of the literal laws of the universe.\" the unemotional katie is tearing up as she says this and she seems to believe what she's saying. she may be wrong but she obviously doesn't believe that she is. did the conversation between lyndon and stewart in the first scene give away how this would happen?  lyndon \"i'm the guy who cracked the problem.\"  stewart \"on a many-worlds principle.\"  lyndon \"exactly, and it worked beautifully. so what's the implication of that?\"  stewart \"he doesn't want many-worlds, just one.\"  lyndon \"but there isn't just one, that's the point. if he wants one world he has to _**change the laws of the f'ing universe.\"**_  stewart \"he's a tech genius, _**those laws are secondary to him**.\"_  lyndon \"he's not a genius, he's an entrepreneur, and _**he's crazy.\"**_  lyndon implies that the reason his many-worlds algorithm can simulate the world so \"beautifully\" is because they do in fact live in a multiverse. he also implies that forest is \"crazy\", and that he would need to \"break the literal laws of the universe\" to get what he wants. what could be making forest so desperate and crazy that he would even consider taking such a crazy risk? amaya, maybe?  i understand that a lot of people don't care for the multiverse concept, fair enough. though we should probably keep in mind how important this concept is to the show.  lyndon, probably the second smartest person on the show, is convinced they live in a multiverse. he says this is the reason that his many-worlds algorithm simulates the world so well. stewart doesn't disagree with him.  in episode 1, sergei is asked why his nematode experiment failed. he responds by saying, \"...it's a quantum type problem. somewhere in the multiverse there's a world where they stay in synch, but it's not this one\".  forest responds by saying, \"i'm not a fan of the multiverse.\"   alex garland may have been foreshadowing a multiverse finale from the jump.   there's also katie. she is undoubtedly the smartest person on the show, and she believes in many-worlds. she believes so fiercely that she used the concept to smack a professor whom she had lost respect for. i think that maybe the lecture scene was meant to anchor the devs universe firmly in a multiverse. by having the two smartest characters on the show defend the many-worlds theory so adamantly, alex garland could be sending us a message. devs is _really_ stressing the many-worlds theory.   alex garland cited [david deutsch](https://youtu.be/knar74swoho), and his book _the fabric of the universe,_ as the main scientific influence behind devs. deutsch is maybe the most prominent intellectual that supports the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. the scientist who's work informed the science of devs is a vocal advocate of the many-worlds theory. definitely something to consider.    alex garland is setting up something big for the finale. in order for that thing to make any sense he would first need to lay the groundwork. an old bit of script writing wisdom about narrative logic says, _to violate the rules of a show/movie, the writer must first define what the rules are._ if alex garland wants to use the multiverse to \"break the laws of the universe\" he needs to first ground the show in the concepts that will allow him to do that.   the concept of simulation theory has been a pretty consistent concept as well. katie described the projections as  completely simulated worlds created by the quantum computer. devs also seems to be attempting to scan real physical objects into a computerized simulation during episode 5. these scenes contain intentionally vague explanations though. but it appears when katie refers to \"packet transfers\" it's implying that devs is attempting to transfer data into a computer, maybe practicing for the day they're able to transfer amaya into a s simulated world where forest will join her?    alex garland is trying to ground devs in real theoretical physics, and the smartest characters keep insisting they're in a multiverse, and the scientist whos work inspired the show believes we're in a multiverse. we may want to consider what this is telling us. between the simulation angle and the multiverse concept this show is dangerously drifting towards deus ex machina territory. and i sincerely hope that garland ties this plot up in a logically consistent narratively satisfying bow.\n",

      " i'm confused with how the characters are acting after they experience trauma.  so lily is kidnapped, drugged and brought to a psych ward against her will.  the police and doctors are involved and complicit.  this is a terrifying situation to find yourself in. not to mention jamie has been tortured and assaulted by kenton.  jamie then breaks lily out of a mental institution.  at this point they are in deep shit. there would be police looking for them and when they inevitably got caught they would just  haul lily back to the psych ward and throw jamie in jail.   the only way to resolve this is to go to forest and make some sort of deal for their freedom.  but for some reason when they get to forest it's like they forgot all the crazy shit that just happened.  lily asks some pretty useless questions and then just decides to go home.  let's just be clear,  the police are likely looking to arrest them. kenton is likely looking to harm them. they are in danger.  a normal person would be scared to go back home.  at the very least wouldn't she make sure that kenton wasn't going to show back up at her house? any small affirmation of security would have been nice.    i was really hoping they would address the reality of their situation once they made it back to lily's apartment.  after all, they had just failed to secure assurances from the psycho billionaire who has made their lives a living hell. and now they know he can see the future. but nope.  just enough time to force a sex scene between two characters that have been struggling to show any chemistry.  oh my god, i don't even want to think about the implications of the sex scene because i don't want that to just wash away the shitty parts of the episode with sex.  bottom line is these characters aren't acting realistic.  it's a problem with the writing as well as the acting and it's upsetting me because i really want to like this show.\n",

      " major alex garland fan here, by the way, ever since i read his book the beach and the tesseract way (15 years ago)? i really wanted to like this show but there are some big and small things about this show that really bother me and keep me from enjoying it.  i won't bother ranting about the totally inconsequential small things (like the idea of god-tier programmers working all day/night from within a fully illuminated and relentlessly backlit golden hued environment..) it looks cool, so... whatever.  it's the premise of the technology itself.  i totally understand, especially at this point in garland's career, that he doesn't get too wrapped up in the \"what/how\" of the technology he uses as a vehicle for his stories. he's focusing on the human element. we get it.  but this show really constantly puts it in your face, so i can't ignore it. contrast this people like michael crichton or james cameron — they're masterful at not just telling stories extrapolated from the perils/consequences/opportunities of technology, but they always do it from a position of better understanding the technology, whether it's biology or robotics or whatever it might be. you can therefore totally suspend your disbelief in the areas that are worth suspending.  so, this show assumes there is this unfathomably powerful quantum computing machine. cool. totally plausible. a total eventuality in our world. plenty of fun stuff to think about in this ballpark.  but they go straight from the base hardware to this notion that suddenly it can (or at least, is on its way to) creating a perfect projection of the past, present, and future — and specifically in the form of some 3d audio/video particle plot whose fidelity and resolution is constantly increasing.  what the show is completely ignoring is that, to actually do this, to be able to calculate the entirety of the world at a truly sub-atomic level — even the presently flawed projection as it's represented in the show right now (which they're all desperately trying to perfect) — you'd need an absolutely perfect \"state\" of the universe to start from. that means knowing the absolute exact state, position, interaction, makeup (etc) of literally every subatomic->atomic particle in the entire universe, all within that initial snapshot. even having the tiniest most infinitely small detail wrong would throw the entire thing off in an absolutely devastating way.  it's like a quantum machine guessing what will happen on a pool table after the next strike, except that we'd be talking about a billion balls on a pool table and that might only account for a single piece of hair on your head, and you'd need to infinitely scale your snapshot data across the entire universe. that even includes what's going at the smallest level for every neuron in every single animal, and everything else you can't see or think about on a daily basis, because it's the combination of all of these things and the dynamics between them that shape reality.  this baseline \"snapshot\" of the entire universe, hell, even a closed sample of the entire earth, is absolutely impossible. that \"starter data\" doesn't just magically materialize itself out of thin air. and you could put a billion satellites and a trillion drones and a quadrillion listening devices everywhere in the world right now with 120k captures and you'd still be nowhere close.  because this \"snapshot\" would literally require every single quantum particle that makes up even a single blade of grass, scaled all the way across every single imperceptibly tiny thing around it, all the way out to infinity, in order to even remotely visualize what happens even 0.01 seconds from now, right before an ant happens to catch some pheromone trail causing it to put its first leg onto that blade of grass.  it doesn't matter how powerful your computer is. it could be infinitely powerful. you still need an utterly complete snapshot of existence as we know it to feed this simulation/projection/algorithm/whatever they want to call it, and that just isn't happening  and the hilarity of it all is.... you wouldn't even need a \"better algorithm\", or some religiously alternative \"approach\" in software to pull this feat off. it's all about that universal snapshot — the thing that truly is impossible to attain. because in theory, if an infinitely powerful quantum computer did possess the entire fixed state of the universe at this very moment, then the entire affair boils down to having a solid physics engine to calculate what happens next, whether it's in reverse or going forward — the same way a basic game engine does.  there are so many more plausible things a quantum machine could do with much more plausible premises that would still fit this general plot/theme/narrative without being such a non-starter.\n",

      " this seems obvious, but it really clicked for me episode 6. here, forest is seen mainly having a conversation and hanging out with jaime. many things in the conversation mad me realize that forest doesn’t represent a wannabe god, but rather a passive one.  consider this: forest had no idea who jaime was, despite knowing kenton had “intimidated” one of lily’s friends. forest had not bothered to know the name of someone who was aiding lily, a person extremely important to devs.  forest had not bothered looking into what kenton meant by intimidation. he gave vague orders and didn’t bother to see how they were carried out. this is a continuous theme throughout their relationship but real stood out in this episode. similar with katie giving lily the exposition instead of himself.  forest asked jaime if he was one of his (employees). this implies he is impersonal to his staff and sees them more as his sheep.   jaime states that forest is at fault for everything, and forest claims he has merely been on the sidelines, observing. jaime then claims this is just as bad. while forest has the power to intervene in almost anything, he doesn’t (although he believes he can’t).an example of this is when forest watches kenton murder sergei.  all of this is not because forest is an uncaring asshole, but rather because he himself believes that everything is predetermined, so he does not bother stepping in to prevent harm to others. especially when he easily could.  forest orchestrates, manipulates and harms indirectly without bothering to look at the consequences of his actions. his guilty is absolved with his belief in predetermination, leaving only half-hearted sympathy to dish out to those he has harmed (lily and jaime)  does this make sense?\n",

      " as a start, excuse the wall of text, i'm in quarantine and extremely bored.  so i've seen a lot of discussion on the sub about what the precise interaction between the simulation and determinism is, and how there's a lot of apparent paradoxes in the show about predicting and not acting out the future, why the premise of the show cannot actually work, why the devs machine is self-contradictory and cannot tell you the future, and so on.  the issue is not with the machine or the prediction. physical determinism and the simulation showing people what's going to happen are completely compatible.  the confusion that i think people have is to understand the difference between a *high-level abstraction* and the underlying physical process. for a simple example, i'll take the fibonacci sequence (it's in the show after all), you can look at this.       def fibonacci(i):           if i == 1:              return 0          if i == 2 :              return 1          return fibonacci(i-1) + fibonacci(i-2)   that's a recursive function to compute the sequence, but the important part is, *in the resulting machine code, hardware or physics, this is translated into a single sequential set of operations*. the recursion is a *human-understandable* trick of sorts. every complex routine in a program, be it recursion, or loops, or self-referential entities, at the end of the day compile to a deterministic set of operations.  daniel dennett/ tor nørretranders , when talking about consciousness introduced the term of the *user illusion* for this. the apparent paradox between free will and determinism is to confuse the high-level *representation* or *interface*, with the real thing. the folder on your desktop is a representation of a folder, but it's not causing anything. it's a convenient story we use to make sense of a system that's too complex to reason about at a level of particle physics.  so the dev computer showing you a future, you seeing the future, and that future happening are all perfectly reasonable and you don't need to get your head in a twist about paradoxes and loops. those are abstractions that make it possible so that human observers can understand, at a high level, what's going on. they are however only representations that don't act in the world or cause any top-down confusion. physics is entirely sufficient to explain the state of the system.  for a larger treatment of this in the context of free will, [i recommend a talk by john searle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kvqkrhg77w).\n",

      " there’s a few reasons i think this.    1. the characters are not acting in a smart way, but in ways that make things more dramatic or that write to the plot.  one example is kenton just plainly approaching the russian spy in the parking garage.    2. writing characters in a way that appeases the story and not the character.  an example is lily.  in the beginning of the show she seemed pretty sure and confident and i just finished watching the scene with lily telling kenton about a guy she used to date having a tattoo and losing her shit because people thought she was crazy.    overall it’s definitely an interesting premise but the writing seems to favor creating a dramatic scene in lieu of following through on a characters traits.    i’ve seen this in shows before and they just devolve into whatever creates the most suspense/action/drama/etc in lieu of actually staying true to a character they’ve already established traits about.\n",

      " does lily’s personality in this show remind anyone else of **neo in** ***the matrix*** *—* before he met morpheus?  she just seems to convey the same lost and zoned-out vibe that neo did in those early scenes before he was red-pilled.  his was the energy of a person we later came to learn had “**always known that something was wrong with the world” —** someone who needed to be “woken up” about the state of humanity around him so that he could become it’s savior.  the more i saw of the “lily-hammer,” the more i initially wondered if she represented someone who has a similar relationship to a **sim**ilar kind of universe.  there’s just so much about her that seems fuzzy & undefined — and so many questions about her **real purpose** that we haven’t seen answered yet.   but the more i think about it, the more i think that episode 6 has given us a ton of information about what’s going on with our main character.  and while i think there’s a lot of cool directions the show could have gone in with the idea of a neo-like **lily in a simulation world**, that idea for me evolved into a theory that’s a little simpler, and a little less literal — but which still involves a parallel of sorts to the journey embarked on by the hero of *the matrix.*  i think it fits well with all the show’s themes of free will and determinism, religious symbolism and science-y stuff ... as well as all the clues i think they gave us in ep. 6.  (ima call it the “**free lily” theory**.)  but before i start boring people with my own theory, let me take a page out of katie’s socratic playbook and toss up this little master list of questions that i think might represent some of the important **unsolved lily mysteries** that remain after episode 6.  and if anyone has their own theories, let’s hear some answers!  1. **why is lily such a weirdo**?  i don’t think i’m unfairly bashing our lovely heroine when i say that she doesn’t *quite* seem to be of this earth.  so is that vibe an unfortunate result of certain acting choices, as some suggest?  otherwise explainable as the quirky character traits of a traumatized tech geek?  or is there something **deep and fundamental** we still don’t know about the lily-hammer? 2. **what were we supposed to take away from that “go” board-game scene?**  we don’t get a lot of background on lily, so it might be fair to assume that this scene w/ her father has special importance.  are there any **hints** being dropped here about lily’s ultimate purpose in the story?  is the scene connected to others that seem to frame lily as a “**player” in a larger game** of some sort? 3. **why is it that f&k didn’t seem quite prepared for lily’s housevisit?** while they did seem to expect her arrival *itself,* they also seemed to be thrown off by the *time* it happened.  (why else would katie still be asleep mere seconds before this all-important showdown w/ lily?)  and why is it that katie had to tell forest how much was revealed to lily after she left — wouldn’t they have been “monitoring” (or at least *co-planning*) these “last 24 hours“ for months?  is there something about lily that already makes her future **harder to predict?** 4. **why didn’t they “seem“ to expect jamie when he showed up with her?**  similar question here.  even if this is was an act, it seemed weird that they’d go to any lengths to act like jamie was some kind of total unknown.  wasn’t the whole point of katie’s talk with lily to convince her that they‘d already seen this totally pre-determined sequence of events,   why contradict themselves? 5. **why did they seem to be “testing” lily?**  the details of offerman’s performance continue to fascinate me, in part because they remind me of oscar isaac’s in *ex machina.*  in the scene where he offers her something to drink, **watch his face** in that long pause after — he’s *interested* in what she’ll choose.  but why?  could he be **testing her tram lines**?  if so, why is she different? 6. **why were f&k so interested in what type of person lily is**?  if lily is supposed to be dead in 21 hours — all according to a plan they’ve already seen happen, mind you  — then why are they so concerned about her intelligence, character, personality, etc.?  is there something about lily that they expect to survive the death they projected — or to be **somehow resurrected**? 7. **why did f&k seem so excited about lily’s (apparently) impending death?**    according to what they told lily, the events that happen in 21 hours are supposed to threaten the whole universe — so why are they discussing it like something they’ve been looking *forward* to?  what is it they actually expect to gain from her death (if that is what they see happening)?  if they just wanted to test their machine’s “**reincarnation power,”** then why wouldn’t they have tested it on someone who would have been easier to ”disappear? 8. **what is it they** ***really*** **want with her??**  this is the key question of *devs.*  whatever experiment they’re running, they’ve gone through a lot to get her specifically.  were they lying about the static?  if not, were they really just “going through the motions” of what they’ve seen happen up to it — or do they think they know what happens after?  i think we can trust that a reconnection of some kind w/ amaya is forest’s motivation ... but it looks more and more like katie is both **running the show** and **keeping secrets from her “boss**.”  *why?*  (if anyone has questions to add, shout out below.)\n",

      " remember that moment in the hospital where lily was staring straight ahead and we were panning-in on kenton’s flowers?  for some viewers, that might have been an example of lily at her most lily-ish: immobile, passive, and seemingly devoid of any personality or emotion.  while forces were gathering against her — locking her up, snapping friends’ fingers, even taunting her with flowers — she seemed to be doing ... well, ***nothing***.  but what was she really doing in that moment?  even in a drugged-out, intellectually-disadvantaged position ... i think she was **looking in them for cameras**.  and we should have been too.  because there might be **a lot more going on** behind lily’s eyes than it seems.  while we’re used to being able to judge the personalities of characters on tv when we see them by themselves, we need to remember that lily was alerted early on — even told directly *by a friggin russian spy —* that she should operate under the assumption that she is being watched at every moment.  and this was *before* she was told about the crazy all-knowing god machine that was built.  keep in mind too that we did get a brief chance to see what lily was like before she was put in this life crisis we now see her in. while she might have still been awkward, i think it’s fair to say that peacetime lily still showed a lot more outward personality.  *now* we should consider if she’s carefully controlling what we see on the surface (and why).  in doing so, we should stop looking at her like a tv character we’re supposed to like and start looking at her personality like **a player across the poker table from us** — a place where not having one could just be good strategy.  and make no mistake — lily’s been seated at a giant poker table since that moment she saw sergei burning.  the only difference is that she can’t see any of the faces that are sitting around it with her.  so why should she let them see hers?  based on some **things that happened in episode 6**, i think that lack of personality people are complaining could just be a very good poker face. because she proved herself to be the kind of player who sits quietly wearing mirror shades — and then makes sudden all-in moves out of nowhere.  that’s the player you have to worry about.  let’s consider:  * **her decision to show up and ring forest’s doorbell in the middle of the night**.  it reminded me of the move you make in poker when your chip-stack is dwindling and you’re getting pushed around.  if someone’s making moves on you, you have to **pick your moment and go all-in**.  it’s not a question of being risky or wanting to gamble — depending on your position, it’s just good strategy at late parts of the game.  win or lose, you force the other players to meet you with their chips and then show you what they have (and how they’re playing).  which led to ... * **lily’s socratic dialogue with kate**.  many people on this sub complained that she should have known much more about “randomness“ as an encryption expert.  but i think garland gave us a big clue in the next scene that we shouldn’t take her answers at face value.  it would be one thing if she just said what she said — but for kate to remark on how smart she found her to be after going-head-to-head?  i think kate could see what garland wants us to now *suspect* — that **she’s straight-up good at this**.  after all, what would lily have gained by showing katie (or us) how much she knows about physics?  the ***next-level*** **move** was the one she made — hiding information.  and she pulled it off well enough i think to fool most viewers, if not katie.  not only is she playing her cards close to the vest, but — like any skilled poker player — she seems focused on **playing the player opposite her**. * **her relationship with jamie**.  let’s talk about **those cards she’s holding** for a moment.  because i think we should notice the parallel that’s been set up by the end of the episode with her very limited, very terse explanation to jamie — it shows how **both she and katie seem to be keeping information from their men on some level.**  which should make you wonder ... did she all the sudden sleep with jamie because she realized that he’s the one she should have kept in her life, or that she can trust him unconditionally?  let’s not be as delusional as jamie — **lily’s in survival mode here**.  she knows that jamie is a card she may need to play — so she’s keeping him as close as possible for now. * **her defensive game**.   speaking of which ... we should consider the fact that jamie —good dude or no — is **kinda weak** (something katie also seemed to point out when she corrected forest and said the bravery was all lily).  you can never totally trust someone just based on how the relationship “feels” — sergei taught her that.  that speech the russian gave her about trusting such things?  **total bullshit** — and now i think she was smart enough to both know this at the time and not reveal that she did to other players. * **player position**.  instead, you have to look at what you know (and don’t know).  and part of that — as poker players learn — is looking at each player’s actual position in any given hand.  sure,  jamie is loyal right now — but how much of that is the pheremones we call “love“?  and yes he‘s still standing tall after one broken finger — but he’s got nine more of those to break.  (”**and ten toes, if we need ‘em!” — kenton**.)  he’s just too vulnerable to be able to trust ... which ironically is another reason to keep him close and in her bed where he can also be watched (just like katie might be doing with forest) — while keeping certain info to herself. * **her relationship with homeless pete** might be considered in this same light.  is he another card she’s been keeping close?  he *does* seem very genuine in his protective stance toward her, of course.  but he could also be all sorts of interesting people, as others have speculated.  i wouldn’t read too much into that affectionate pat she gives him on the shoulder — she could be “keeping him close” as the action winds up.  and has if she does trust him, it‘s probably for smart reasons.  she might know the mysterious things about pete that we don’t.  so by the end of the episode, lily went from heavily-sedated and trapped in a motel room to **back home on her court, with two chess pieces protecting her** (whoa metaphors).  not only that, but she managed to gain key information — about the players she’s facing and about the game itself — all while keeping her own cards close to the vest (and sending a message that she can‘t be intimidated).  and she did this through good poker strategy — **knowing when to push your chips forward**.  i’m not saying she’s put herself out of danger, of course.  katie’s out there making moves i can’t even begin to comprehend — while kenton’s now moving to become that “third player” which could push this whole thing into the realm of the unpredictable.  but i think she’s earned the right to be respected.  i may not have quite fallen “in like” with her, as katie and forest call it.  but then again, i don’t think she would give a shit how any mere spectators to the game would judge her personality right now.  it’s only smart poker not to.\n",

      " i just caught up and subbed here so i'm a first time poster, apologies if this has been discussed already.  i started watching the show in the background while doing other things, but once the lecture hall scene occurred i keyed in a lot closer. i really like multiverse theory, and appreciated the way that episode explored it by showing so many parallel realities.  i'm hoping things don't get too \"fringe\"y and feature forrest trying to 'kidnap' his daughter from a dimension in which she is still alive. i very much wonder what end goal they are trying to achieve specifically. i could see this \"remote viewing\" as being the first stage of a grander goal (communication? transportation?), but think it could work fine as just the ultimate answer in global surveillance. that discussion is a different post though...  obviously that question is set up to be the primary driver of the show's plot arc, but the season arc seems to revolve around an event (likely featuring lily and an imminent visit to devs) that will take place that causes them to lose the ability to see into the future.  some serious clues were likely dropped in the lecture scene's different interpretations of the dual-slit experiment, and while i didn't catch all of them in the first viewing (i may go back to get names to research, but please let me know if someone already made a post on it), i think the simple fact that they are focusing on the quantum element of observation collapsing the wave function could lead to an answer of what occurs.   they are able to view the past and future up until a certain point because they have a computer that can do it. although fuzzy, these 'viewing portals' are very much a collapsed function of all the potential outcomes.   the inability to see past a certain point suggests to me that the entire spectrum of possibilities exist at that point... in other words, the wave function of the future has not collapsed at that point. the 'interference pattern' of all the potential outcomes manifests itself as impenetrable static.  the reason the future exists as a wave of many possible outcomes as opposed to a definite (destinate?) answer is because **the ability to observe has been lost at that point.** up to now, the act of observation has restricted the timeline into a predestined and foreseeable future (or at least a narrow and closely overlapping range of potential outcomes)  how has it been lost? well, the simplest answer is that the devs computer is taken out of the equation somehow. once the computer is down and they lose the ability to perform the action of 'observation', all locations/futures are possible again.   i won't suggest who shuts the computer down or why, but i feel like the season ends with the (at least temporary) loss of the computer.\n",

      " i've been thinking more about the different projections we've been seeing, and what trend or reason is behind the spots in time devs chose to view. jesus being crucified, joan of arc being burned at the stake... but then also abraham lincoln giving the gettysburg address, and marilyn monroe fucking arthur miller.  katie gets pissed off about the porn, and says \"stick to the grassy knoll.\" well, jfk's assassination, christ's crucifixion, joan's burning to death -- these are all pornographic acts if you are viewing them solely for the fascination value of it. katie is revealing an inconsistency, which kind of hurts a theory i've seen on here that she's a cyborg (i happen to buy into this theory but that's a separate thread, and i still buy into it despite her inconsistency).  her inconsistency is that she relishes in watching certain things through the machine as well - she has been spying on every character this entire time. her voyeurism is a form of porn addiction.  is devs commenting on society's current approach toward the modern-day internet? is quantum projecting through time and space the next youtube/youporn?   all of the amaya/devs characters have some flaw about them.  lyndon's is coloring outside the lines.  katie is a hypocrite. kenton is stuck back in the cold war-era military-industrial complex.  forest has the biggest flaw of all, in that his whole motivation behind the technology is to **project his dead daughter.**  make no mistake, his ultimate goal is to play god (though one can argue that's the basic motivation behind all human endeavors, but that's a whole other philosophical conversation).  so we see projections of amaya, of key historical figures, of lily's past, and of lily seemingly dying on the gold mesh floor. lily is clearly a christ figure, similar to neo in the matrix (another thread put forth this theory and i subscribe to it as well).  we hear joan of arc's muffled last cries as lily re-enters amaya for the first time since sergi's death.  her big event is working out to be a sacrifice that somehow prevents devs from doing something.... bad? weird? we don't know.    but katie sure hates not knowing!\n",

      " since this show is about topics like deteminism and free will, there is a mental phenomenon called “the interpreter”, which makes up reasons for why we do what we do to explain it as a decision of free will. it is usually hard to show any examples in normal humans, but it gives itself away in those with a split brain:  https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2020/01/16/the-weirdness-of-split-brain-experiments/  \"the split-brain literature contains many examples suggesting that two conscious points of view can reside in a single brain. most of them also topple the typical notion of free will, by exposing a phenomenon generated by the left hemisphere that [michael] gazzanaga and his colleague joseph ledoux dubbed “the interpreter.” this phenomenon occurs when the right hemisphere takes action based on information it has access to that the left hemisphere doesn’t, and the left hemisphere then gives an instantaneous and false explanation of the split-brain subject’s behavior. for example, when the right hemisphere is given the instruction, “take a walk” in an experiment, the subject will stand up and begin walking. but when asked why he’s leaving the room, he will give an explanation such as, “oh, i need to get a drink.” his left hemisphere, the one responsible for speech, is unaware of the command that the right side received, and we have every reason to think that he does in fact believe his thirst was the reason he got up and began walking.  as in the example in which experimenters were able to cause a feeling of will in subjects who were in actuality no control of their own actions, the phenomenon of “the interpreter” is further confirmation that the feeling we have of executing consciously willed actions, at least in some instances, is sheer illusion.\"  ***  but if we have no choice, then why the need for the brain to justify the decision?   another experiment: volunteers pressed a key to make an object appear on the screen. the image appeared on the screen instantly when the key was pressed. at least at first. but gradually a tiny delay was introduced, one step at the time, to give the brain time to adjust. then it was suddenly back to normal again. but by then the brain had adjusted to the delay, so for the volunteers it looked as if the image appeared before they pressed the key, even if it was the other way around. they explained it by saying it was the image that made them press the button. so whenever they saw a new image on the screen, they had no other choice than to press, because they had already done it despite not being aware of it.  https://tinyurl.com/uwaaftw\n",

      " a story isn’t one thing. the death of the author, etc. however, a story is one story. it has a point. garland tends to tell very small stories...  a traveler who finds a small commune. a trio of survivors continuing to. a skeleton crew on a desperate mission. two men asking questions about a woman. four women trying to figure out which questions to ask.  small *dramatis personae* on a claustrophobic stage. stories in isolation. you can do a lot of things there, but you can’t do too many of them. the story has to be about something—meaning it can’t be about something else—or else it ends up being about nothing.  and, having seen episode 7, i realize that i’ve been watching the wrong *devs*.  so, let’s talk about *iliad*. it’s not about the trojan war, it’s about the battle if egos between achilles and agamemnon. there is a lot of lofty language about both of these men, but we tend to think of achilles as the hero. he’s the one on the journey and our media indoctrination biases us in his favor.  but it’s hard to say how homer feels about him. it’s even harder to say how the greeks felt. three-act structure didn’t exist, yet. the ancient greeks didn’t have the storytelling saturation that we do. their biases were formed by entirely other things; things we can only guess at.  scholars assume that *iliad* survived because it was beloved and beloved because it supported the values of the people of the time. we imagine achilles as a proto-proto-proto-byronic hero; all broody and doomed and too aware of his own flaws to fix them because he would stop recognizing himself if he did. we watch achilles desecrate the body of hector—knowing paris will avenge his brother—like a 15-year-old girl, class of 2005, in her high-cropped tank top and flared, velour sweat pants, pining for a 20-year-old in a tool t-shirt with hoobastank cranked to maximum daydream.  or we write the son of thetis and peleus off as yet another ancient asshole using a woman as measuring tape for his dick.  homer is a dead author. well and truly; to the point that many experts dispute whether he even existed. his authorial intent is so obscured by the attrition of time that it is mere formality to even call him the author. is it even achilles’ story? what if hector is the real hero and homer turned his camera on the hometown boy just so he could eulogize the real hero and get people to listen? what if achilles was always the villain and we took the bait off the hook like we did with *breaking bad*?  we don’t know.  alex garland may die, as all authors have, but he’s not going down without a fight. we passingly scratched our heads about the visualization of christ crucified, but continued to discuss the science and the philosophy, but mostly the science.  but now, he’s shown his hand.  garland believes that forest is wrong. we might have guessed that, but plenty of villains end up being right. he’s not just wrong, he’s a fool. the man can’t even tell that philip larkin isn’t shakespeare on a cursory, linguistic level. moreover, he can’t guess. not out of ignorance, but because he can’t.  forest is so wrapped in certainty that his mind is unable to abstract long enough for him to make guesses.  it’s not about dramatizing the nature of reality. this is a show about knowledge. what we do, don’t, believe, and reject.   the crucifixion is iconic, in every sense, but so is walking on water. forest can watch the march to golgotha. he can watch a carpenter’s son tortured. he can be certain that there was a teacher named jeshua who was executed by the romans and continue to be certain. if he watched that same man walk on water, he would have to start believing. that vision would demand faith.  if you wanted to know if jesus was god, you’d try to watch him walk on water, turn water to wine, or walk with moses and elijah on the mount of transfiguration. forest doesn’t want to know, he wants to be certain. that’s why he fired lyndon.  all of the science is a stand-in for humanity’s desire to know. lily wanted to know what happened to sergei and when she did, she had no idea what to do with that information. she knew and nothing changed.  knowing changes nothing “and that’s the point.”\n",

      " **contains twist spoiler[.](https://imgur.com/gallery/rhptftg)**  **the bridge scene**  at the beginning of episode 7,  lyndon is shown sitting at the bottom of the dam and he is very much alive, [image here](https://imgur.com/gallery/cd2sex5).   during the set up to the dramatic fall, katie and lyndon are talking about [quantum immortality](https://youtu.be/qtzzujnrbf8). this means that lyndon only dies in some branches of the multiverse and he lives in other branches. alex garland shows us a few of the branches where lyndon falls off the bridge, and it's shown using the overlapping multiverse effect. the [multiverse effect](https://imgur.com/gallery/maflbcx) is also used when katie is walking away from the bridge. this means the events played out differently in other branches. we weren't shown all of the branches in the multiverse, some of which contain branches where lyndon doesn't fall.  there are also branches where lyndon falls but misses the concrete and lands in the water.  according to his perspective, the branches where he dies never happen because the lights just go out.  he only has conscious experience of the branches in which he lives. this means that lyndon isn't dead, not totally at least.   **the introduction scene**  the first thing we hear in episode 7 is a voice talking about \"bleeding bruises\" that comes from a recording called _come out._ this steve reich produced vocal collage creates an interesting auditory effect by [\"phase shifting\"](https://mathbitsnotebook.com/algebra2/triggraphs/tgshift.html) the sound waves in and out of sync. this is explained more thoroughly here, [come out](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/come_out_)  what are we to make of this unusual recording and its possible function towards informing the story? i would argue that the process used to created the sound,  not the actual words themselves, is the important aspect.  and that process is phase shifting.   quantum [wavefunctions](https://www.quora.com/what-does-it-mean-physically-for-a-wave-functions-phase-to-vary) are prone to phase shift. this causes destructive interference which leads to decoherence. these arcane concepts are covered in the double slit experiment that was highlighted in episode 4. alex garland's choice to explain these ideas in the lecture scene was deliberate right? so why add them if they served no use to the story?  lily's coworkers are talking about \"sine wave phases\" at exactly ten minutes into episode 3. this conversation happens immediately after we see lily walking into work. we also hear the distorted joan of arc vocalization from an earlier projection scene at the exact moment her coworkers are taking about wave phases. of the dozen words her coworkers use in that scene, \"sine wave phase\" are three of them.   also, homeless pete is laying down [cigaretts in a sine wave pattern](https://imgur.com/gallery/s6lkxr7) in episode 2. this sine wave visual seems very deliberate and purposeful and i believe it's all connected somehow.  anyway, i hope someone can offer more insights into this wave offset concept that alex garland keeps sourcing from. it has an ostensibly deeper meaning to the show and may hold some explanatory value.  edit:  i'm adding a link to this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/devs/comments/fxl409/devs_s01e07_discussion_thread/fn8t286?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) where i walk through the logical steps that brought me to the conclusion that the image of lyndon is from another branch of the multiverse where he survived the fall.\n",

      " i'm sure the character of forest \"knows\" this, but the answer to his question about how nothing can change in 5000 years: symbolic language had not yet been invented.  prior to language, the only information propagation system (on earth) was dna. while successful, dna accumulates new information slowly, at least from our language-based perspective.  you don't have to invent fire-making because someone long ago figured out the process and passed on the instructions. not through dna, but through grunts, gestures, and finally symbols, such as those you're now processing. your information processing unit depends on matter organized by dna, but \"transcends\" the limits of dna-based storage through access to a larger data space: the [noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noosphere).  the arrival of symbolic language was a \"singularity\" event, just as dna's arrival was. the key concept of a \"singularity\" (in this context) is how what's next is unknowable by whatever exists pre-singularity. rocks couldn't perceive life, life couldn't perceive mind, mind can't perceive... whatever is next.  singularities don't erase what's come before. today there are still atoms, molecules, rocks, viruses, plants, dogs, etc... all of which are not consciously participating in our language-singularity data-space. in my personal view, the next singularity, perhaps to be glimpsed in the show, will enable mind to manipulate matter at sub-atomic scale, something a machine of the show's capacity would enable (beyond merely observing other points in time). resurrection, for example.  when mind controls matter as easily as i control my body's tissues at the resolution required to translate my thoughts to the keyboard and up into the noosphere for your consumption... that's another singularity, and a future unknowable.\n",

      " so there’s this very interesting argument about “**free will**“ from a philosopher named **karl jaspers** that *devs* seems to be drawing upon.  after stewart recited the “*aubade“* poem in episode 7, this argument seemed to get even *more* interesting.  if you take a look at it, i think it tells us **where this is all heading**.  jaspers’ argument basically states that our ability to radically transform ourselves in crisis situations is what gives us **genuine free will**.  we all *seem* on a day-to-day basis to be spokes on a mechanical wheel, acting and reacting predictably based on a kind of “habitual programming.”  but in certain deeply-traumatic situations — what jaspers calls “**boundary situations**” — we are forced to confront deep vulnerabilities that we typically ignore and thus transform ourselves.  according to him, it is **human freedom that allows us to redefine our identities** when they are challenged.  you can read more about **boundary situations** in [this chapter](https://www.utm.edu/staff/jfieser/class/120/4-freewill.htm) from an online philosophy textbook (it’s in a section called “personal transformation” under **part c: the case for genuine free will**).  here’s a sample:  >for each experience we are presented with, we have an automatic and standard response.  but, as mechanical as we are with our reactions, do not we all at least occasionally experience **major events that defy our habitual programming and force us to break new ground**?  this is especially so with traumatic situations of suffering and conflict.  in these cases, we feel helpless to the overwhelming forces outside of us, and in that state of despair we **break free of our ordinary habits and explore new ways of looking at the world.**  i think this idea explains what’s been happening with lily — and maybe even why she’s been put through everything we’ve seen.  in fact, lily’s life experiences at the hands of the devs team are *textbook* “**boundary situations**” ... seeing loved ones die, losing one’s freedom, facing death ... these are all direct examples of those situations jaspers says force us to confront our vulnerabilities and make choices that redefine who we are — *outside of* any predetermined mechanics.  they are situations, in other words, that permit us to “**break free** of ordinary habits” and exercise genuine free will.  what if that’s what forest and katie have *really* been up to with devs?  what if everything that she’s been put through is their experiment to see if they can essentially “**break lily’s tram lines**” and set her free from a deterministic world ... basically by killing the “old lily” and resurrecting her as a new identity, with **real free will**?  if they are successful, after all, would that not essentially break all of us free from the deterministic machinations of the universe that their system has been running on?  wouldn’t the “butterfly effect” of lily having actual, free choices mean that all the other characters would, too?  couldn’t that — lily’s first act of genuine free will in her new identity — be what “breaks the machine” and causes all the static they are allegedly seeing in the future?  well, anyway — that’s the basis of my “**free-lily” theory**.  as i said, i’ve been [considering for some time](https://www.reddit.com/r/devs/comments/fvv5nc/the_free_lily_theory_part_1_unsolved_mysteries/) whether lily is a character like **neo in** *the matrix* (in the sense that she’s a “player” who needs to be “woken up” from the simulation she‘s living in).  but i think this theory works **whether or not you see this world as a literal simulation**.  (if everything is pre-determined, after all, does it even matter which is the simulation and which is the ”real world”?)  maybe it’s lily’s ability to gain genuine free will that makes this a “real world” of sorts — simulation or no.  my general feeling is that lily’s first freely-made decision will be one of sacrifice in some way — hence her “dying to free humanity.”  as homeless pete told her, the old lily’s life is gone (“**the choice you have now is about what your next life will be**.”).   and just as pete himself chose to break free of his “defined responsibilities” in order to save lily, so will she likely have choices to make about what she will “reborn as.”  &#x200b;  i do have more thoughts on the theory, but i’d rather hear from others first.  does all this sound bonkers?  if not, any thoughts on what will happen next?  i will leave you here with a quote from jaspers himself here on **boundary situations**.  notice how closely what he says tracks with the “*aubade*“ poem that stewart recited in episode 7 (which was all about how humans try to ignore the specter of death):  &#x200b;  >”i must die, i must suffer, i must struggle, i am **subject to chance,** i am **entangled with guilt**. these fundamental situations of our existence we call boundary situations. that is, they are situations that we cannot alter or change. . . . in our ordinary lives we typically avoid them by closing our eyes and living as if they were not there. **we forget that we have to die**, forget our guilt, and forget our vulnerability to chance. . . . in boundary situations, however, we respond by either covering them up or, if we really grasp them, we respond through despair and recovery: **we become ourselves by transforming our consciousness of being**.”\n",

      " so the way i see it so far, there appears to be only one true universe. the multiverse as it stands is not truly supported in any real sense. according to the data presented in the show, in the true/alpha/prime universe or whatever you want to call it, amya created the devs machine. now this machine is capable of near perfect predictions of past and future events. from what i can gather it does so by analyzing all material on earth/universe down to the subatomic level and using quantum computing to create a backwards and forwards prediction simulation of everything. now this simulation being a perfect(?) simulation is where the “simulated” multiverse stems from as each simulation will have its own copy of the devs team and devs machine which causes simulations within simulations into infinity. as these billions and billions of simulations run simultaneously and branch off each other they will loose fidelity of the prime universe(copy of a copy principle) and start to create inaccuracies from minor to major resulting in eventually every possible outcome of every possible situation to occur in some form or fashion. now i have a theory that the show we have been watching is not the prime universe but just one of the many simulations. the reason they cannot see forward in time past a certain date is because the machine producing their simulated universe is either destroyed or shut off. this means a simulated universe on a higher level when shut off will cause a chain reaction which will cause all underlying simulations to cease. all simulations above that simulation will remain intact so the multiverse will continue to branch off into infinity. the only way for the whole multiverse system to cease is if the prime universe were to shut off their simulation. at that point only the prime universe(which was the only real one to begin with) will exist.  now they are hinting that lily will be the one to shut off the machine. she can’t power down her own simulation but since the simulations are basically copy’s of copy’s, it’s safe to assume that if she shuts off the machine in this universe that there are billions of levels of simulations above hers where she does exactly the same thing(turning off the machine). so since she cannot turn off her own simulation, if you were to climb the ladder of hierarchy there will be one simulation that is unaffected after the power down sequence, but all underlying ones will cease to exist. as fascinating as the concept is, it would be a shame for the show to end on a downer like that so i’m thinking they are going to maybe realize that they are not real people, that they are only simulations of real people... this will either drive them into a self realization of lacking free will and will either make them lose the will to exist, causing them to all agree to end the simulation as a final act of their own choice or they will realize they since they are within a simulation, that they are only bound by the laws of physics/ reality as the devs machine dictates. that being said, maybe they will now be driven to hack the simulation to create one that allows them to manipulate their own world, or jump their consciousness into a higher level universe to escape their simulations destruction or somehow attempt to communicate with the prime universe via hacking of the simulations. i dunno. there are a lot of ways this can go but my imagination has been running non stop since this last episode! what are your thoughts?\n",

      " first of all, i do think determinism is correct, and that everything was determined by something prior. however, the scene in episode 7 where all the devs watch the simulation screen and then stewart runs a \"mirror\" simulation showing the room 1 second into the future, that seems off to me.  it seems plausible to be that in theory the behaviour of all these people could be predicted correctly.  what doesn't seem plausible to me is that *showing them the prediction* wouldn't affect the outcome.  it's like how forest said in episode 4 when talking to katie in the simulation room: *“what if one minute into the future we see you folding your arms, and you say, ‘fuck the future. i’m a magician. my magic breaks tram lines. i’m not going to fold my arms.’ you put your hands into pockets and keep them there til the clock runs out.”*  i was already discontent there with the fact that they didn't try that experiment out then and there.  in a way, it's a version of the time travel paradox. *showing* someone a prediction of their future will modify their behaviour and thus *change their future*.  that's why i thought it was weird that in the mirror simulation scene everyone behaved exactly like the simulation predicted they would. the only way i can explain it is that maybe the simulation ran through a ton of steps of recursion, including the way people would react to seeing their own prediction in what it showed them, until it converged to the point where the final image differed only in minuscule, negligible details from the way seeing the image would further modify their behaviour?\n",

      " last night, i was having a discussion in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/devs/comments/fynfqs/its_all_gonna_work_just_fine_he_said/fn2a2oa/?context=3) and today a few lines from [this article](https://collider.com/devs-interview-cailee-spaeny-lyndon-gender/) peaked my interest and i think i makes me confident this is true. i haven't seen other people post about this, but i'm sure i'm not alone in thinking it, so please link any post that has presented the same idea if you find one.  >i needed to meet with alex, every day. he took a little notepad and he drew pictures. he was like, “okay, so this is the quantum universe.”  so, in this article, cailee spaeny, the actress who played lyndon, was discussing the process of the audition and just after. the first thing she described alex garland do was draw pictures of the quantum universe. this appears to not just have been necessary for the topic of the show, but for explaining how it is told and what her character's role would be in that story.  the way time was presented in the bridge scene where lyndon died implies there are a variety of different ways time can progress, but it always goes in the same direction with the same outcome. this seems like it reflects what we observe in quantum mechanics, especially with regard to the [observer effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/observer_effect_(physics)). the observer effect is the demonstrable theory that observation of a phenomenon inevitably changes it. the act of measuring something on the quantum level causes wave function collapse that causes an irreversible change.  time is presented as working in a similar, or identical way. once time is observed, it is irreversibly changed and has collapsed into one single state, rather than the several possibles it once had. this is why lyndon always fell and why katie walked away in all sorts of different ways. those little details are what are undefined and to be seen, the way somebody reacts to the wind is not measurable until it is measured, and then it is assured.\n",

      " i'm more interested in exploring the character and storytelling themes of the show rather than the science and concept theories i'm seeing here.   so garland has talked a lot about how silicon valley figures perceive themselves as gods, how they basically live in a bubble. he’s directly critiqued their single mindedness within the show, and critiqued how unjust their power is in episodes like when lily faked a suicide attempt. in the interview from last month with offerman (you can find it on youtube), he says how a common perception of science is that it has all the answers, but he sees it as something more uncertain and that the people who think they know actually don't.   look at the endings of ex machina and annihilation. garland’s directorial works have had a theme of women being beaten down and broken by the world around them, only for them to outsmart and conquer that world in the end. in em, oscar isaac was so certain of the world he built, so certain of his genius, and it all imploded on him. he was completely wrong about his creations. forest is the same. him and katie are cult leaders, their creation is this machine that tells them the future and they obey it. they are culpable for their actions and lily is coming to expose them and make them confront what they’ve done, that “life is something we watch” is total bullshit. forest and katie will probably go completely insane after they’re still breathing when lily breaks the simulation. this not only seems to me in line with garland’s other work, but also just a way more compelling end to the series than just the villains basically being correct. to me, this show has always been leading towards that, the confrontation between a normal person’s life that silicon valley thinks nothing of in exchange for the reality they’ve decided must be real. it was kind of crystallized in that scene of forest and katie just smiling and giggling about dinosaur movies while lily walks up to devs, completely emotionally destroyed and lost. they didn’t care at all, they never have. they lied to jaime and killed him, withheld information from lily, killed lyndon and sergei, all for their own personal motivation. “i couldn’t change it” isn’t an excuse, and i’d be pretty surprised if the show doesn’t make a definitive statement about human choice before its over.\n",

      " in the first episode sergei and his team make an algorithm that can sync with and predict the movements of a nematode in much the same way that the devs machine works. they have studied the nematodes neural patterns and atomic structure since birth and deduce a synchronous simulation based off the data. the experiment can look backwards and forwards but the issues they have is that within 30 seconds the simulation looses sync with the nematode because of the lack of computing resources and/or the possibility that the nematode it is syncing with, is part of another world.  now let’s apply that to the devs machine. what if they experience the same issue with syncing their universe with the devs machine? thus the machine creates a simulation of the entire universe which starts out as perfect, but then because of lack of processing power or memory constraints it loses sync with the original universe and goes slightly off script as did the nematode simulation. now take that same scenario and then apply it to the simulation that is taking place within that simulation. it will also lose sync and deviate further from the original universe. this will go on into infinity and create an infinite number of universes that continually deviate from the prior universe it was attempting to copy. so each copy of the copy of the copy of each simulation is evolving into something slightly different, and yet very much the same. this is what might be causing what we perceive as the multiverse or many worlds.  also since these simulated realities are based on reality but still encoded by a machine, they create deterministic realities that cannot be deviated from what has been predicted by the machine(since the alleged reality is actually a program written by the machine and must be executed as such). at this point, i’m not sure if i’m explaining it right, but basically i’m saying that it is deterministic because all the characters in the show are not real people, but very convincing avatars of people, and as such do not have free will because they are part of the program and have to follow the path set by the simulation. only people in the original universe would have free will since they aren’t bound by laws of the simulation. the wild card i’m guessing is going to be lily. her consciousness i’m thinking, even as a simulation is so strong that it can disobey the script. much like neo in the matrix. but i don’t want to draw any similarities with that franchise.. i was just using it as reference to the fact that lily is special.  anyhow, what are your thoughts?\n",

      " to recap: katie and forest think devs has built a machine that shows your future and is always right. this is, as many have pointed out, real weird.  in analyzing that possibility let's start with a claim that the many worlds theory is correct in this show. we've seen the visual representations of it after all. in this theory the worlds are constantly branching; every quantum possibility becomes real in a different world. it is very important to note that this is incompatible with perfect prediction. any prediction about which branch you'll end up in made before the branch will look correct in one branch, but wrong in all the others. an obvious, if annoying, solution presents itself: katie and forest are wrong but also very unlucky.  how is it possible to be so unlucky? well remember, infinite worlds exist and we're only watching one. but that one world wasn't chosen at random, the copernican principle does not apply. instead we may have picked our world through an authorial selection bias towards drama and irony. what sense would it make for garland to be showing us the boring world where the first time they look into the future they try doing the opposite and say, \"oh, yeah, not sure what i was expecting, of course i can change the future\"? with this theory i can explain away pretty much anything that seems too coincidental, which is great. clearly it was possible so why shouldn't we be watching a world where some crazy coincidental stuff happened, like, say, a machine that looks like it predicts the future but doesn't?  so here goes: i believe the machine actually simulates only one of the infinite many worlds that are possible. in each of those many worlds they are obviously also running a simulation, but this time they will be simulating a different one of the possible many worlds. this is tautological in some sense; a thing cannot contain within itself both itself and other things, so each level of the simulation has to be different simply by virtue of one being within the other. eventually one of the simulations will run a simulation of a many world where they try to view something on the screen but the machine is broken for some reason. as an example, one reason might be that it runs out of memory as lyndon mentions when they're first projecting outwards. in this world with the broken machine, the simulation continues; showing what would happen with a broken machine. the higher level simulation shows that result to the people watching, which allows that simulation to continue and show the result to the next level up, and on and on up the chain.  at every level there would be no guarantee whatsoever that what ends up happening looks anything like what they saw on screen since it's a different many world, but it's also possible that it does. certainly it's more likely to turn out similar if the people watching the simulation want to keep everything the same.  so here's where the static comes in: the next person to use it to look forward will be the first since stewart said \"it works fully now\". stewart doesn't say that until after the mirror room scene, leaving the possibility that there were still a few final fixes needed. i propose that if the machine works fully then there will be no simulated world where the machine is broken. if there's no world where the machine is broken then we cannot observe the time past when we try to look at the screen in the simulation. this is because the simulation will not progress until it has simulated a world that can progress in time without needing to view the results of a lower level simulation, and a world like that only exists if the machine breaks. the ironic result is that only a fully working machine is broken for simulating the future; we need an error to break the infinite loop.  the result would be that if you're living in a simulation created by a fully working machine, you would not observe time ever progress past the point where someone attempts to look into the future with a fully working machine. only in the top level world, or a simulation created by a broken machine in the top level world, can they attempt that and still have time continue. since broken machines eventually reach a limit to the number of worlds they simulate whereas fully working machines never stop simulating new worlds, just as we assume that the existence of a simulation makes it likely that we live in a simulation we can assume that the existence of a working machine makes it likely that we're being simulated by a working machine.  the ending will be a boring scene where someone scrunches their eyes and doesn't do whatever they were predicted to. someone will attempt to look into the future to see what changed, and time will either stop or not depending on whether or not they're in a simulation (they are, in my opinion).\n",

      " so this week's was okay to me, and the one before i liked best in the series.  i think that now that a lot of the mystery of ep. 1 has been answered, we can see things like, no robot girl isn't super cold and mechanical because she's a clone of his dead daughter or something;  she's just a genius with low emotional-iq, so that's just bad acting/directing.  etc.  so as of this many episodes in, i'm going to make my interpretation of what alex garland seems to be saying:  1. people in the tech industry are so smart that they're stupid. 2. people in power in the tech industry are bad people with little regard to human life. 3. emotionally unavailable women are very attractive. 4. life is cheap, or at least, killing off characters is a cheap way to try and shock an audience or otherwise try to make them feel something. 5. cinema is about cool pictures and weird music, instead of building a solid story foundation.  at this point i'm prepared to put alex garland, as a filmmaker, into the same category as george lucas:  clearly he is very imaginative and smart, has bold ideas and is very talented at world building, \\*and\\* he's better off having other people write the actual scripts and direct the actual movies.  this is not an insult or saying he's less-than, anymore than saying that a genius cinematographer isn't as good at directing or at composing a score.  everyone has their gifts and strengths;  alex garland is clearly in that top 1% who is having stuff made for theater and tv.  personally i feel like ex machina was an exceptionally well-told story/well made film, and since then the stuff he's done has been really flawed in the story-telling department, and that all these problems are fixable in the writing.  as i recently heard someone phrase it, \"you're saying they shot too early a draft.\"  yes, exactly.  the screenplays needed more rewriting, and maybe some fresh eyes, to catch some of these flaws before tens (hundreds?) of millions of dollars were spent.  p.s. i totally called it after the pilot that the homeless dude was a spook.  i guessed cia and it turns out he was the opposite of that.  but nonetheless, it just felt too obvious that he was there for a reason, despite six episodes of him dancing to street musicians and generally seeming to be a commentary on homelessness in the u.s. in general and sf in particular.  i was so busy feeling vindicated i almost didn't notice how implausible it was for him to show up just in the nick of time to save lily's life.  shrug.\n",

      " correct me if i'm wrong, but in the fifth episode, katie stated that her favorite theory is the everett theory or the many world theory. but forest doen't like that. he even fired lyndon because he used that theory. so, why did he hire katie if she supports the exact theory that he hates? and he also said an interesting thing to katie in episode 5:  > is there any world that it could work?  the answer might be whatever he has planned. which doesn't seem to just be creating a device to see the past and future. but the hints at his main plans have been weird. some hints make us think as if he just wants proof that he had no other choice and her daughter's death isn't on him. some hints made some theories that he wants to bring her back to life, which i don't quite understand. but generally he seems to be motivated by his daughter. in what way, i don't know.  some might argue the reason he hired her was that he knew he could have been wrong and wanted the best of the best no matter if they had a different belief from him. but he fired lyndon for the same exact reason. so now what? he only uses the best if they agree with his restrictions? doesn't make much sense.  is there something i'm missing here, or we just have to wait to find out what his actual plan is for the device to understand?\n",

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doomsday\\_cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doomsday_cult)  \"doomsday cult is an expression used to describe cults that believe in apocalypticism and millenarianism and can refer both to **groups that predict disaster and those that attempt to bring it about to destroy the entirety of the universe**.\"  i have been puzzled why they seem to think the world is going to end and are also obsessed with keeping things on the tram line. they want the world to end.  forest and katie are both nihilistic. after seeing and trying to alter the future to no avail, they have embraced the end. destruction is their only release and freedom from determinism.  what always happens when a doomsday cult hits the apocalyptic date? nothing. forest and katie will be revealed as frauds and the only thing that will be destroyed is their world view and ego. maybe a suicide of the leader and follower. \"who is mark antony?\"  it is all summed up in lily and katie's conversation in episode 6. lily says \"what if you are wrong ... your tech cult is wrong ... its just a machine\"  the actual reason for the \"event\" will probably be simple, just a flaw in the machine or a bug in the code. but whatever the cause, nothing will happen in the real world.\n",

      " i was rewatching devs with my girlfriend last night and noticed something last night that i'm 99% haven't been discussed here yet. i rewatched today to make sure i wasn't making things up.  there is a very big difference between the 2 car crash scenes that we see (episodes 5 and 7). i'm not talking about the multiple scenarios that play out around forest in episode 5.  when we first see the car accident sequence in ep 5 (around 31 min in), immediately after forest says \"i know we can discuss it in thirty seconds, we can also discuss it now\" we hear \"beep beep,\" then see the crash. *immediately*. he barely even finishes the word \"now\" before the crash happens.  however, in the version of the sequence in ep 7 (around 5 min in), we hear forest *finish* that sentence, then see his wife respond with a *full sentence* \"no, i'm hanging up. you know i hate talking and driving. you can't wait thirty seconds.\" then a brief pause, no accident, before it cuts back to our familiar view of forest ripping his headphones out.  either this is an uncharacteristic oversight by alex garland, or we are absolutely seeing two different versions of this conversation. there's no way episode 5's version of the crash would have had time for forest's wife to respond with a full sentence and pause. i'm not sure what this means but it got me wondering if anyone else has noticed any other discrepancies between repeated scenes.\n",

      " idea: alex garland read \"[i don't know, timmy, being god is a big responsibility](https://qntm.org/responsibility)\" and was inspired by it.  taking some ideas from that story...  what we have been watching is all a simulation. stuart alludes to this idea very directly when he says that: within their simulation, there is another simulation (i.e. a simulation of their simulation), “ad infinitum, ad nauseam”. perhaps lily will destroy the machine that is running the simulation. this could explain why our characters have not been able to see past some point in the simulation: if we were watching the “real” (base) world, the simulation would still be able to show everything past the point of its own destruction. but if we are watching a simulation, the devs simulation we know (which would really be a simulation within a simulation) would not be able to show anything beyond that point, *because there is nothing beyond that point in that (simulated) universe*: the (simulated) world we know actually does cease to exist at that point. this means the simulations within each world are consistent and accurate for the “layer” they are in, but they must be inconsistent with each other (between layers) for that to hold true. but i think there's more here.  as that short story points out: the simulation is only has perfect fidelity to the real world as long as the top layer doesn’t alter the simulation (and turning off the power is certainly an alteration) -- so there's no contradiction here. the top (real) layer programmers can, for example, code some glitch into the simulation. in the real world, that would look something like: the some developer intentionally programs something \"fake\" into the simulation (e.g., inserting some new object into the world). the real world programmer sees the glitch manifest in the simulation he is observing. at this point, the simulation has diverged form reality (intentionally). from the point of view within the simulated world, what would we see is: the programmer adds the object into the simulation, and he sees that object actually appear in his own world. as soon as the programmer makes a change in the simulation, it actually manifests in his universe. this is how the “residents” of a layer can tell if they’re in a simulation or not. (but note that the simulated programmers would only even attempt this if the \"real\" programmers did as well.)  forest will take on the role of this \"god\" -- he will alter the devs simulation by programming amaya back into the “present day” in the simulation. in doing this, amaya will actually appear in their world as well -- forest has revived amaya, but he has proven that they are living in a simulation. (there would be some top-level world -- the \"real world\" -- where amaya does not reappear, but i don’t think that will prove to be the layer that we have been watching.)\n",

      " okay, so what the machine appears to be able to do is 1) back-calculate everything as it happened in the past (as of ep. 7) and 2) run simulations given a certain set of input parameters.  by changing/approximating variables it is possible to simulate any past or future. you can change variables in the past to see how the outcome is affected, and you can simulate the future by giving entry parameters and simulate based on that. however, you only simulate the future based on the parameters given at the start of the simulation (this is important).   when watching a  simulation of the future, the simulation will have to include information about what you saw when observing the future. however, that information is tied to the input given at the start of the simulation, before you start viewing it. so when watching the simulation, you will see a version of yourself with \"future knowledge\" based on the input at the start of the simulation. if you see yourself taking action a in the simulation, but then instead take action b at the same point in time, you have reacted to the simulation and altered the variables that the simulation was based upon. so if you wanted to truly simulate taking action b, you would have to input yourself seeing action a at the start of the simulation. if you'd try to simulate the screen itself, you'd just see infinite levels of simulations, some identical, some wildly different. theoretically you could see yourself taking any action you could possibly take.   in short, what i'm trying to say is that you're not predicting the future, you're simulating the future based on the input given at the start of the simulation, which is really past information when the future happens. if you decide to defy the prediction, you're not really acting on knowledge of the future, but on information obtained in the past (when watching the simulation). that means that a prediction is only accurate if you do exactly what the simulation shows.  i think the theory that the show is set in a simulation is correct. to forest, it's important that he is a part of a simulation, as that would mean he has no free will, and couldn't have done anything different. that's also why he doesn't deviate from his railroad tracks, because he knows that doing so would mean he's not part of a simulation, and has free will.\n",

      " wanted to post max tegmark's [classifications of multiverses](https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/pdf/multiverse_sciam.pdf)and explain what i think we will see in devs.  * level i: parallel worlds exist because spacetime is infinite and has a fairly uniform distribution of matter and energy: everything that the physical laws would allow to happen within our universe does happen, even if almost if not all of it is beyond our cosmic horizon (the limit of our observation given the limitation of the speed of light and the accelerating expansion of the universe) * level ii: multiverses exist because cosmic inflation continuously, infinitely creates bubble universes. these may have variable laws, physical constants, and composition. universes that can support life such as ours may be extraordinarily rare, but given an infinite number of bubble universes, there will be infinite universes very similar to ours, all far beyond our cosmic horizon * level iii: hugh everett's many worlds interpretation: every single possible quantum outcome occurs, splitting into multiple parallel universes as they do (outcome 1 occurs in one universe, outcome 2 in another, etc). as in levels i and ii, everything that the physical laws of a given region of spacetime allows to happen does happen, splitting countlessly with each quantum outcome. **the devs team initially think that they are projecting various regions of spacetime from this model of parallel universes** * level iv: tegmark's mathematical universe: math is the ultimate underlying reality. i understand this one less than the other 3, but i believe that it would be compatible with a simulated universe, where the \"math\" is the source code of a massive quantum computer. **i believe that the devs team is realizing that they are in fact in a level iv universe in the form of a simulation**\n",

(which lily tried to contradict) * how did forest get into the system? he said lily broke the deus system, but what happened that actually put the two of them into the machine? * **can the real world in which forest and katie died still be a simulation?** near the end of the episode where the senator and katie were talking, senator asked if they know they are in the simulation (everyone except for forest and lily), katie said they won't know because the simulation and reality is pretty much indistinguishable. so, the \"real\" universe in which forest and lily dies can still be a simulation, they will never know, right? or am i understanding it wrong ? * so, the reason there was static after forest and lily dies is because of their death, the machine stops simulating the universe they were watching, since they are no longer alive, and thus the static? am i right?  **edit 1: is stewart going to jail for killing forest and lily?**\n",

      " what could happen if katie entered the simulation with forest? how could this influence the external world?  katie obviously loves forest. do you think she would be willing to upload herself to the simulation and live in the \"best\" simulated world with forest?  if she decided to then ideally, she would set it up so she could co-exist in both worlds, but visit this world with him on her downtime. she could continue to be mentored by forest and obtain his advice about situations that are happening in the \"real world\".  also, this would allow forest (in the simulation) to continue to run his real company externally, under the direction of katie (in the real world). forest could never die or be prevented from influencing the base reality unless the devs machine was \"turned off\" or destroyed or the connection between reality/simulated world was disconnected.  knowing forest, he could create contingency plans to insert himself as computer code (like viruses) in other areas of the external reality (outside of the devs machine) and continue to maintain external influence (if he so wished).  garland made a comment that sounded as if ex machina and devs could co-exist in the same universe. if this is the case, then \"forest\" could merge himself into a super ai and truly prevent anyone from stopping the simulation (in the real world) by out-smarting them. then taking this a step further, if \"forest\" merged into a super ai, he could figure out how to \"3d print himself\" back into base reality (similar to the black mirror ep \"be right back\", but perfected), as if he never died. if this happened and \"forest\" maintained the same motivations, then he could bring back his daughter in base reality as well.\n",

      " i've seen multiple people discuss the ending, as in whether or not it makes sense. some of this might have been mentioned, but i wanted to share my thoughts.  i think the most importent line to understand the ending \"she comitted the original sin.\".  we all know the story. god gave adam and eve one order. to not eat the fruit from the forbidden tree. if they agree, they can live in heaven. but they disobey him, and by doing do, they commit the original sin, and get banished from heaven to earth. they were beings unable to commit sin, but because they did the one sin they were capable of doing, they and their disendents were free to commit whatever sins they like. and if they didn't, if they rejected this freedom, they would be brought back to heaven.  the story of the devs, or deus as it turned out, is similar to this. the deus machine, their god, shows the path they will have to take. but lily chose not to. lily had to kill forest and then be killed by stewart. but then lily changes the course. lily choses to change the predetermined actions by throwing the gun away and not killing forest. hence, she commits the original sin of disobeying the one rule. act as it was determined. but doing so, she changes the world.  ok. this last part is a bit of strech, and maybe, possibly, with a high chance wrong. but, at the same time, maybe it could be true?  what i'm talking about is this. the universe was deterministic. humans were unable to make a choice the same way that the heaven was pure, and humans were unable to sin. when the original sin was commited, the humans were set free to sin as they like, but they still had the option to remain pure and in return, be awarded with return to heaven.  when the original sin of lily was commited, the universe changed as well, and it became undeterministic. it became free.  also, the reason that lily was able to make a choice was the same as the story of adam and eve. they weren't able to sin. but the forbidden tree, in itself a chance of doing sin, existed. and in the show, the existence of devs machine was the reason lily was able to break the rule.  so as i said, when the original sin of lily was commited, the universe changed as well, and it became undeterministic. it became free. but still, there was the option to not sin, or in this instance, act as it was determined. that's what stewart did.  the idea of determinism is a torture for our minds, but at the same time, it's freeing. it would free forest from thinking that he caused his daughter's death. if the universe was predetermined, he wouldn't be blamed. but what happens when you learn that the universe is not deterministic, or more accuratly, what happens when the universe has stopped being deterministic? it would be torture for someone like forest, as it would mean he could have chosen otherwise and stopped her death. and also, it could have mean that stewart could have saved people like lyndon from dying. but if the universe was deterministic, it would not be his fault.  >because i've realised what we have done. >**don't blame me** katie. >it was **predetermined**.  stewart realized in the previous episode the real plan of the deus system. it was to stop it from being deterministic. yeah i've dropped another bombshell but i'll explain this one later. for the moment just go with it.  stewart realized the dues system would both confirm that the universe is deterministic, and that there is a way to stopping it and changing it. but he would not like that idea. the poem he resited in the previous episode is an interesting one. if you read the poem, it is talking about the way of our lives and the unresting death that will be brought to all of us one day. talking about how our lives become pointless because one day we die, and the fear of death destroys us. but at the same time, the poem is suggesting that the way to escape from this fear is to get lost in routines. to get lost in life. the poet thinks life is pointless due to death, but yet suggest getting lost in life to escape the fear of it. stewart might fear the determinism of life, but at the same time, he wants to get lost in it. when stewart saw what lily did, how lily changed it, he didn't do the same. he remained inside his deterministic tram line, and did the actions he was always supposed to do. he killed lily (and forest) because he wanted to live with determinism. he wanted to not blame himself. he wanted to be predetermined. to get lost in the routines. and he left deus with his remaining belief in determinism. even though the future is not clear, for him it is. he just can't see the strings, and he is fine with it if it means it's not his life. he wanted to leave dues and live with deus, without ever knowing the future anymore. and with this, we can understand why the last thing that the machine showed was lily's death. it was the last thing that was ever determined. anything after that, stewart talking to katie and after, was all a choice.  deus. devs. simulations. many worlds. what about them?  well, this one is a strech, but i'll try to bring as much reason as i can. i can't go into the science stuff much, so what i talk about is what i felt how the show explained it's universe.  there are many worlds, each with it's own determined path, living with each other. the fact that many world with many situations exists doesn't change the fact that they have a predetermined system. they are lucky in some situations and unlucky in others. the events differ, but all exist at once. or rather that's how the machine worked. so with the machine working with laws of universe, i guess it means that it means in reality, many worlds exist too, not just with the machine. because of the determined path, the machine cannot create a world of it's own. which is exactly what forest wants do, with the help of katie.  this week, i asked a question in this subreddit. if the machine can replicate billions of minds, can't it create a mind of it's own?  well, the series is asking a question like this. if the machine can understand the universe and create replicas of billions of worlds, can't it create a world of it's own? and if you take the concious of one, and put it inside, wouldn't it be in a way... alive? it's not a computer simulation. it's a perfect replica of world. some are bad. some are good. but they all exist within the machine. they are in a way... alive.  that's what forest and katie wanted to achieve, and that's what stewart feared. creating a world in the way you want it too, because in stewart's idea the world was real, would've been an end to determinism. because you can replicate a dead child in those worlds and bring it back to life, then death would be meaningless. determinism would have been meaningless. and it seems while stewart fears death, he can't live without it as well.  but the simulated world couldn't have been created until determinism existed. the same way everyone had a path, the machine had a path as well.  i know i'm a little bullshiting here. it's hard for me  to prove that the machine couldn't have created a simulation while determinism existed, but the events in the show seems to suggest that, or at least that's how i feel. but there are holes in this explanation, like the scene were the mouse was brought back to life on the system. so the show might not be suggesting this after all.  but something else to point out. i asked a question this week, in why forest hired katie if she believes in the many world theory, while forest hates that? i think the answer can be found in this episode as well. the reason forest hates the multiverse theory isn't only because he wouldn't get his own amaya on the projection. it's because that he wants to create a world inside the system, and wants to be in the world where he is reunited with his own amaya. and i think the reason he hired katie was because he thought he would help her best if she knew why he was doing it. both of them think there might be a way possible to do it in a way that only brings out their own universe, but lyndon proves that for the machine to work, they have to bring out alll the universes. resaulting in the scene between lily and forest, how he tells her that they live in multiple worlds now. each different, but still exist.  and finally, let's talk about the themes of the show. it's themes very much reminds me of the ending to inception and the leftovers. let's start with inception.(obviously spoilers if you haven't seen the film, which if so, what is wrong with you?) while many argued about whether it's real or not, some, like myself, questioned whether it mattered or not. the question was simple. does our belief in it being real matter? if we believe cobb is happy to be with his children, and if he choses for it to be his reality, does it matter if it's reality or not? i'm still undecided for it myself. while i think cobb would indeed be happy in whatever reality that makes him happy, the question of whether it matters that it is reality or not baffles me. does it matter if he is happy if it's not real?  and then the leftovers (again, spoilers, and if you haven't seen the series i'll send the russians after you if you don't) the series ends with nora tell kevin what happened to her, and kevin chosing to believe her. but the series never showed the events that nora talked about. hence, many started to argue as to whether it's a lie or it's truth. some took strong positions on it, argueing for their positions, trying to disprove the other. while some, again like myself, had more fond for a discussion on whether or not it mattered. i chose to believe nora. but i'm again undecided on whether or not her story was true. does it matter if it's true or not if i chose to believe her and think they'll be happier in believing?  devs, or deus, creates the same question. does it matter that determinism has stopped if stewart choses to believe in it? does it matter that that forest and lily's death is stewart's fault if he doesn't believe it is? does it matter that the simulation is technically not reality, that lily and forest and his family are all technically dead, their bodies non existence, if they have a life inside the simulation and feel happy? does it matter that it's not real, but to lily and forest and katie it is? all of this questions brings us back to the ultimate question of the show.  **does it matter that our lives are predetermined, if we believe we have free will?**\n",

      " before challenging some of the show's assumptions about free will and determinism, let me just say that i loved devs (or “deus”, if you prefer). it was one of the most ambitious shows i've seen in a while, addressing questions ranging from the metaphysical implications of quantum mechanics to simulation theory, and it managed to do so without boring its audience and without holding its hand, respecting the intelligence of its viewers. so all things considered i'm very happy with the show, and i hope garland will soon get another chance to explore some of his ideas at length on television. that being said, i wasn't entirely satisfied with the show's rather simplistic treatment of free will and determinism, and in this post, i will try to explain why, starting with some preliminaries.   **preliminaries: what determinism is not**  very roughly, determinism is the idea that the course of the future is fully determined by the conjunction of the past and the laws of nature. in other words, the future is *fixed*: given some past state of the universe and the laws of nature, future events – including our choices and actions – are inevitable. the future is therefore already set in stone, and no matter how much we deliberate, our decisions are incapable of altering its path.  to many, this is a very strange – and indeed, scary – idea, and i admit it is highly counterintuitive. but in popular philosophy it is often confused with similar but importantly different ideas, and the show sometimes also seems to fall prey to these trappings. i will here focus on two such ideas, the first of which is the idea of “fatalism”. this, very roughly, is the idea that not only is one's future set in stone, but one's psychological processes and actions do not make a difference as to whether that future comes into being: in other words, if fatalism is true, your agency is *bypassed*, because certain events will happen whatever you do. a good illustration of this idea is the story of oedipus: it was simply his fate to kill his father and marry his mother, and whatever choices he makes will always lead him down that path. but determinism has no such implications: if determinism is true, then one's mental processes *do* make a difference and are causally relevant as to whether a particular future is realized (or at least, there is no principled reason why they should not), in the sense that its realization is (in part) dependent upon which choices and decisions you make. had you acted differently, then the future would have been different: your choices and actions are an essential part of the causal chain – they just happen to be predetermined.  another idea that determinism should not be confused with is what i will call “agency epiphenomenalism”: this – as i will understand it – is the idea that one's choices are “epiphenomenal”, a mere side-effect of processes that bypass one's agency. if this is true, then there is a very real sense in which your choices do not matter, because they are not a part of the causal chain, do not influence the course of the future. daniel wegner has famously argued for something like this, claiming that our sense of conscious decision-making is a mere side-effect of unconscious processes that do the real causal work. this may be true – though the evidence for it is not clear-cut and the idea that everything outside of our consciousness is alien to who we are is problematic – but it is again not something that is implied by determinism: rather, it is neutral on this question. our conscious decisions might be epiphenomenal, but determinism as such has no such implication: it can perfectly well accept that they are an essential part of the causal chain, and that the future could have been very different without them.  with the preliminaries out of the way, i'll now go on to challenge some popular assumptions about free will and determinism that the show – and much popular philosophy – seems to make. of course, my arguments are not going to be uncontroversial, and others may reasonably disagree with some of them: i hope to at least convince you, however, that the relation of free will and determinism isn't nearly as self-evident as it may at first appear.   **assumption 1: indeterminism can rescue free will**  sometimes the show seems to hint that all that's needed for free will is for determinism to be false: if one of the deterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics is true, there can be no free will; but if one of the other, non-deterministic interpretations proves to be correct, we can have free will after all. but this is way too simplistic.  indeed, philosophical discussions of free will often begin with a kind of dilemma. imagine first that determinism is true: you walk along a predetermined path that your choices cannot alter – so, it seems, there's no free will. but now imagine that *in*determinism is correct: now there are multiple paths open to you, and your choices may even sometimes affect which path you will take. does that give us free will? well, not quite. if indeterminism is true, then our choices are no longer predetermined, but what we get instead seems to be mere randomness: our choices are the result of mere quantum fluctuations that we have no control over. for example, imagine that we are split between two decisions, and that which decision we make is held hostage to quantum fluctuations: in that case, even if there are multiple paths open to us, we have *no control* over which path we will take. the choice is made randomly, guided by probabilistic laws, and we are left out of that process, have no say in the matter. and if you ask me, that is hardly an improvement over causal determinism: we have simply exchanged predetermination for randomness. indeed, the situation may be worse: on determinism, at least our decisions are what do the causing; but on indeterminism, probabilistic variation also plays an important role, so our agency seems less important.  what can we conclude from this? well, in my view, at least, the metaphysics of determinism and indeterminism isn't all that important to the question of free will. rather, the challenge comes from something that eddy nahmias has called “mechanism”, which is roughly the idea that our actions and decisions can be given a mechanistic explanation, that human beings do not stand outside the natural world of impersonal causes and effects but are just another part of it. if that is true, then our actions and decisions can eventually be traced back to influences that we have little to no control over: our biological make-up, our social environment, where we're born, who we meet, and so on and so forth. and that, in turn, means that how we turn out is essentially a matter of luck: we do not choose who we become but simply end up one way or another and have to work with what we have. and that makes the idea that we “deserve” to be punished for our crimes in any deep way rather difficult to defend.  indeed, some philosophers (like galen strawson) have argued that the traditional notion of free will is simply *incoherent*, does not make any sense when thought through, whatever metaphysics we work with. how so? well, whatever metaphysics we accept, our choices always have to come from *somewhere*: if they aren't rooted in who we are, then they cannot intelligibly be understood as *our* decisions. but if our decisions are rooted in us, where do we come from? previous decisions? but then where did *they* come from? eventually you will reach influences that you did not choose. in other words: free will requires that our decisions are intelligibly ours; but the very attempt to explain how this could be so rules out the coherence of an entirely “free” will. of course, it is possible to abandon such explanations, to throw one's hands up and say that free will is a miracle that *cannot* be explained by mere humans. somehow, to quote nietzsche's scathing description of such attempts, we “pull [ourselves] into existence [by the hair] out of the swamp of nothingness”. that may be an acceptable cost for religious folk, but for those less willing to hand-wave miracles, free will of the traditional sort seems difficult to defend.  however, as we will see now, free will need not be understood in a traditional sense.   **assumption 2: determinism rules out free will**  before going into the specifics, i'd like to begin by pointing out that the question whether free will is compatible with determinism or not is in fact incredibly controversial among philosophers: they have debated the question for centuries yet they are still massively divided on the issue of free will. that being said, in recent years one position has proven significantly more popular than others, at least in the english-speaking philosophy community: as it turns out, however, it is not the idea that determines rules out free will but that they are *compatible* (an idea that is called “compatibilism”). in the most recent philpapers poll that surveys professional philosophers' philosophical beliefs (see https://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl), for example, 59.1% of respondents “accepted or leaned toward” compatibilism . so many philosophers would reject the idea that determinism rules out free will. and if experimental philosophers are to be believed (which i won't go into here), many ordinary folk are conflicted too.  how so? well, as they point out, even if determinism rules out free will of the traditional sort, it leaves many other (more everyday) freedoms intact, and even if prephilosophically many would not think of free will in those terms, they argue, it is *better* so understood (more on this later). for example, instead of in any deep metaphysical way, we could understand the “freedom to do otherwise” in a counterfactual sense: *if* we would decide to do otherwise, we could. as an illustration, compare two people: one is in prison, the other is a regular adult. and let's suppose that both contemplate visiting their families, and both decide against it. the regular citizen, however, is clearly more free than the prisoner: if she had decided to visit her family, she could have – nothing stops her from doing so. but the prisoner is simply incapable of visiting his family, because he is, well, imprisoned; and he is therefore in an important sense less free, because he could not visit his family even if he wanted to. and there are many other kinds of freedom that determinism does not touch: for example, people can still exercise self-control, reflect on their values and then decide to act in that way; they can still contemplate which course of action is best, which action they have most reason to perform, and be responsive to their resulting judgment; and so on and so forth.  now, at this point some of you will probably think: hold up. it's all nice and well that we can still exercise self-control if determinism is true, but that is not *free will*: compatibilists are simply changing the topic! instead of addressing the metaphysical question whether we *have* free will, they choose to engage in a merely verbal dispute over whether this or that *should be called* “free will”. but in my view, this is not quite right: the dispute between compatibilists and their critics is not merely verbal – rather, it is *ethical*. an underlying assumption of the debate, as i take it, is that “free will” is a kind of freedom of a particularly important sort, one that is – or should be – at the center of our practical lives, one that is, to paraphrase daniel dennett, genuinely *worth wanting*. and what the compatibilists are saying is essentially that the kind of freedom (or kinds of freedom) that is (are) most important to our practical lives (or certain aspects of it) is (are) perfectly compatible with determinism.  because think about it: what does traditional free will actually *do* for us? sure, it reinforces our traditional self-conception, but tradition is hardly sacrosanct, and we might very well be better off without it. so does it make us better off? does it make us better and happier individuals that are more virtuous and more prosperous than we otherwise would have been? it seems to me it doesn't: for that, we have to look to the freedoms that compatibilists are talking about. you don't need radical self-determination for happiness: what you need is relevant knowledge and self-control – and, of course, a fair bit of luck. and you don't need it to become a good person either: rather, what you need is knowledge of what morality requires of you and the willpower to see it through.  however, as many of you will probably have realized by now, this still leaves one central question unaddressed: even if traditional free will doesn't exactly make us better off, don't we need it for moral responsibility, to deserve blame or praise for our actions? that is the question to which i will now turn.   **assumption 3: determinism rules out moral responsibility**  let me begin by again pointing out that whether determinism rules out moral responsibility is very controversial: unfortunately, i don't have statistics to back me up this time, but given that, for most philosophers, free will and moral responsibility are very closely related, most compatibilists about free will can be assumed to hold the same position when it comes to moral responsibility. so compatibilism about moral responsibility – counterintuitive though it may seem to many – is again a fairly popular position in contemporary philosophy.  but what really interests us are, of course, the reasons *behind* its popularity, and that is what i will now turn to. the driving force behind compatibilism is again the idea that the kind of moral responsibility that *matters*, that we *should* center our moral practices around, is not ruled out by determinism. in order to see why this is so, let us first see why they believe that moral responsibility of the traditional sort is *not* valuable.  there are many different theories of punishment in moral philosophy, but they can roughly be classified into two kinds: retributivist and consequentialist theories. retributivist theories argue that criminals (and sinners of other sorts) should be punished for their crimes simply because they *deserve* to be punished: in their most radical form – which we see in many religions – it is even argued that some actions warrant eternal damnation. consequentialist theories, on the other hand, argue that sinners should be punished because doing so has good results, because it makes our society better off: if criminals know that there's a significant chance that they will be punished for their crimes, then they are less likely to commit them; isolating dangerous individuals from society reduces the amount of crimes committed; and placing strict sanctions on certain kinds of harmful behavior conveys a clear message to citizens that such behavior is not acceptable, and that those who aspire to be good citizens are to avoid it. for such theories, criminals needn't “deserve” to be punished in any deep way: in a sense, they may just be unlucky. far from being a good in itself, it is simply a necessary evil, because society can't function without punishment. but that isn't something to celebrate: rather, the necessity of sanctions is a regrettable feature of the human condition.  of course, consequentialists aren't advocating that we weigh the relative benefits of sanctions and forgiveness on a case-by-case basis: that is not just inefficient but also goes against human nature. rather, their justifications for our punitive practices are normally kept in the background, and should only come into play in decisions with very high stakes, and broad evaluations of those practices and whether they serve our aims. and this is where a fresh, non-traditional notion of moral responsibility can come into play. how so? well, consequentialists obviously don't advocate that we punish people randomly: rather, we should do so for principled reasons – that is, we should have good reasons for thinking that such behavior is typically beneficial. but in some cases, this clearly isn't the case, and this is were traditional criteria for moral responsibility come in. for example, suppose you hurt someone by accident: in that case, punishing you seems pointless, because accidental occurrences are out of your control. or suppose you were forced into certain behavior at gunpoint, or were not in your right mind, or are fundamentally incapable of appreciating moral reasons: in all those cases, there seems to be little point in punishing you (though in the latter case, isolating you from society – or sending you to a therapist – may be justified). and we can come up with a consequentialist theory of moral responsibility based on such instances, where the idea is roughly that you are morally responsible for an action if and only if you did it voluntarily and intentionally, and are a normally functioning agent that can appreciate and be moved by moral reasons, because punishing you would be pointless otherwise. and relatedly, you are blameworthy – and in a sense, “deserve” to be punished – if you meet the relevant criteria; and you are “absolved” from blame – blaming you wouldn't be “fair” – (only) if you don't.  in my view, the idea that the point of punishment is to make our society better off is quite attractive: it not only gives us a principled justification for its institution, but also makes the important point that making the suffering of sinners a goal in itself is cruel, and that we should punish no more than society needs to flourish. in other words, it suggests that we reform our punitive practices so that they are humane and actually work for the better of society, and that is an idea that i personally find highly attractive. that being said, many of you may not be consequentialists, and may find such an approach to moral responsibility objectionable. however, note that this is just one compatibilist theory among many: non-consequentialist accounts are also available. i focused on it mainly because i personally find it quite attractive, and it's easy to explain, but it certainly doesn't exhaust our options.   **conclusion**  tl;dr determinism doesn't imply that our choices don't matter: it just means they're predetermined. indeterminism isn't much help in rescuing the traditional notion of free will, because random fluctuations over which we have no control isn't what we want from “free will”. but fortunately, many ordinary kinds of freedom are compatible with determinism, and those are much more important to our practical lives than the traditional notion. and although determinism provides a stark challenge to the traditional idea that we “deserve” to be punished for our crimes in some deep metaphysical sense, alternative, more humane justifications for our punitive practices are available.  ps: i had planned to include more examples showing that devs (or more exactly, its characters) does indeed make these assumptions, but i kind of forgot to do so while writing this. i hope it is clear that it does make at least most of them, though: for example, in the final episode, forest says that, if determinism is true, people don't really make choices, which points to the conflation of determinism with agency epiphenomenalism; and there are many instances where its characters seem to assume that determinism rules out free will and moral responsibility.\n",

      " it's true that katie and kenton stated on several occasions that things must play out in a predictable way in a deterministic universe.  but when contrasted against their expressed caution against looking into the future, it implies that they were at least suspicious that determinism was only conditionally predictable.    the ending loosely touched on a concept outlined in isaac asimov's foundation series that involved a mathematical approach to predicting human behavior in the field of \"psychohistory\".  in foundation, behavior could be predicted so long as people weren't aware of their predicted futures.  perhaps   which is all to say, they were right about their understanding that the universe is deterministic, and at least had some lingering suspicions that peering into the future was \"against the rules\" from the start, and that it might ultimately lead to altering the predicted future.  none of this is an especially profound take on the ending, but these were my initial thoughts after watching.    what isn't clear to me, is whether \"derailing the trams\" has any detrimental implications to the existing universe beyond no longer being able to make predictions, and whether those implications were indefinite.\n",

      " i am fresh off the finale, and forgive me if i'm spouting the same things as others but i wanted to put my thoughts in writing to help me figure out what the whole show is about.  i've had an idea for awhile, at least since ep. 4, that this show would deal with purpose.  a person's purpose, why they get out of bed, what the point of living is.  the show tries to say that our purpose is fate, that we will always stick to a path even if we know what lies ahead.  but there's also the side that says, you determine the path and are free to choose where to go.  forest/katie are deterministic.  they know what will happen and they offer no resistance to it because to them, that is their purpose.  life for them will always turn out this way.  forest would always lose his family, he did not fail, he did not have a hand in it.  lily/homeless guy(pete) is freewill.  pete says live your life to the fullest, be present.  lily can choose, defying the projection of the computer.  lily choosing presents a problem.  how can the universe be both deterministic and...not?  funnily enough this is also a quantum state, it just hit me.  but anyway, i do not think it can.  i believe it was freewill the entire time.  forest is a man who is stuck in the past, who has a woman (katie) who loves him right now.  he chooses to keep himself chained to his past life.   the big reason i think there is freewill is because of the line that lily's fear is that she won't do what she wants, whereas everyone else is afraid to do what they want.  this means that it makes sense people would follow the projection because they are afraid of actually acting in the manner they want to.  they are afraid to be wizards, as forest puts it.  they are afraid that they have agency in their lives.  forest believes that the past is a cross to bear.  lily believes that it is the present that needs to be experienced.  this is a familiar philosophy from i believe hinduism or buddhism, and is important in meditation.  google living in the present and look at the ideas that pop up.  it's all about as pete says, living life the fullest.  i think the ending speaks directly to human fallibility.  that we can make mistakes but we shouldn't dwell there.  she has a chance to go back to sergei but she instead chooses jamie.  why is that?  perhaps she made a mistake breaking up with him.   the show also speaks to the idea that you can't change the past.  a man can't step into the same river twice because like the river, time is always flowing.  what has happened has come and gone, you cannot rewind the river.  the only thing you can do then is to experience what is happening right now or else you'll miss the big salmon swimming down stream while you're looking at something that's already passed you by.  lily chooses what she feels is \"strong\".  she picked that move in go because it felt like a good move, while others would have doubted.  this goes back to what i was saying earlier that lily fears most to not do what she wants.  others would have doubted that move because they fear what may happen.  they fear to do anything, and so like forest they cling to the past and cannot see the beauty of what they have in the present (katie).  who frankly got the saddest ending, loving this man who may or may not have loved her back and feeling compelled to sit in depression for the rest of her life watching as he enjoys his afterlife, enjoying something she can never have.  dang.  oh yea and so what is our purpose?  i believe it is to experience life.  now this is an idea i have learned long before this show aired so i've got a bias toward that interpretation.  but characters like stewart add to it.  lyndon is fired, he tells him to enjoy life, that he is young and has so much time ahead of him to experience.  stewart explains that the best music (iirc) was genres like the blues which is music which speaks to emotion.  emotion which comes about from daily life.  living, loving, losing.  stewart does not like devs in the hands of forest/katie because they do not understand why people do the things they do.  he doesn't want devs to get out because people are so afraid of living already that it will completely kill passion.  the passion that creates art, that is the basis of the human experience.  he doesn't want everyone to be unable to guess, to be unable to experience the present.   i don't know if that makes sense.\n",

[where the story of lilith began](https://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends-europe/lilith-0011377)  _\"since adam names the second female eve; lilith was identified as the first female in order to complete the narrative. thus, genesis 1:27 describes the creation of adam and first wife as an **independent,** **powerful**,_    _\"in the post-biblical period, rabbinic sages identify lilith several times by the title “the first eve,” indicating that her full story was well known in oral tradition. finally, in the tenth century bc in babylon, an anonymous writer who included in his book some other tales of **\"lilith’s bold behavior\"**_  lilly comes from the root name lilith. in the previous passage lilith is described as \"independent\", \"powerful\", and \"bold\", exactly the way in which lily is described in the show. also, in the biblical account lillith is punished for not being sexually subservient to her husband because this is a sin, technically the original sin, considering lilith came before eve. because lilith came before eve, lilith was the bold, independent, strong, woman who committed the \"orignal sin\". and remember, the strong, bold and independent lily is told by forest that she \"committed the orignal sin\" by breaking determinism.   the over arching themes about faith, religion, messiahs, determinism, and choice were all wrapped up in that one line of dialogue. this implies that forest and lily are the first people to enter paradise (the simulation). and they were also offered this afterlife by ~~god~~ deus.\n",

      " we learn that everything inside the system is a simulation; the past, the future and the parallel world forest and lily end up living in. but because the simulation is perfect, it is just as real as the real world as long as it's running.  so every time they use the machine to create a simulation of the past, or the future, they are actually recreating the whole world. and then they end the simulation. which means everybody in the world they were watching, for instance the stone age people and all the other beings living there, is wiped from existence.  even the one-second glimpse into the future in the previous episode meant the creation and destruction of a world. the fact that their own world is still there should be enough evidence that it is not a simulation. also that lily could make a choice of her own proves it; a perfect simulation of the future only works if the real versions of those inside it doesn't recieve any information.  what would be great is that you could resurrect humans in the system with all their memories intact from when they died. some of the greatest minds in history died much too young. this way, they would be able to continue their lives and breaking new grounds.  what if alan turing was resurrected in our own time, with access to modern computers and information technology?  or someone could simply resurrect james dean, who assumed he survived the crash, and have him return to a simulated version of hollywood where he would continue to make movies. devs could then store these new films, both james dean and others, and release them under the name \"devs productions\".  and one could learn the secrets of building a stradivarius violin and other lost arts.  don't know if alex garland has already mentioned it, but a guy named frank j. tipler wrote the book \"the physics of immortality: modern cosmology, god and the resurrection of the dead\", where he share the same thoughts as in this last episode of devs.\n",

      " here it is, a spoiler filled review.    you have been warned.    summary: this show showed great promise and had some brilliant and profound ideas, but was bogged down by terrible writing, horrible characters, and straight up nonsense in terms of logic or flow of plot. “exposition over emotion” should be the tagline of this show    first off, what works:-   +the sound design, the sound effects, the background score, literally everything related to sound was simply fantastic. possibly the best sounds in any tv show i’ve seen in a while.  +good cinematography, great at times. the lighting in some episodes was just clumsy and some scenes were just too dark to even see.  +great editing: this alone saves so many scenes from being utter trash. the transitions between scenes and sudden scene cuts are great to see.   now, what doesn’t work:-  -the writing: absolutely pathetic. the characters are cheaply and badly written, very unclear motivations, none of the characters are even remotely interesting.  the plot, doesn’t make enough sense. the exposition is too confusing to follow and the end result is a garbled mess.  lily has zero emotional intelligence the entire season, very hard to care about, barely anything interesting about her whatsoever. very hard to get behind her as a protagonist. she literally doesn’t even care that jamie died and the first thing does is ask the homeless guy why he was counting in russian while choking the other dude. i mean, who gives a shit that he was counting in russian (which is already ridiculous to begin with) ? her boyfriend (or ex, whatever) just died and that’s the first question she asks.  there is zero emotional consequence, or weight on these characters. it’s just plot plot plot. she asks that first because plot, because we need to know what the true role of the homeless guy is (not that i even cared at that point)  besides why did homeless guy tell her to run to hong kong ? wasn’t it clearly self defense ? he and lily should be 100% okay there.   most of the characters in this show (especially lily) don’t even act the way real human beings would in that situation.   another example of exposition over emotion(that should be the tagline of this show lol): she goes to forrest’s home and doesn’t ask then why they don’t leave her and jamie alone, doesn’t tell them to, instead —- drum roll —- asks them what devs is. i mean, wtf garland ? are you sure lily isn’t a robot ? what is this reaction ? is this actually what a real human being would do in this situation? this is fucking screenwriting 101 that the writers fucked up.   and why did the homeless guy wait so long to tell lily he was a spy too? so stupid. his boss literally immediately tells her in episode 2. why didn’t he say anything and live like a homeless dude outside her apartment ?   in terms of plot:- there’s a ridiculous point early in the story where lily and her friend trick this cia security guy with a cheap gag of distracting him with lily pretending to be insane and committing suicide outside his office so that they can get access to his office computers security tapes.   im sorry, but what the fuck ? wouldn’t his computer be locked ? why did he so easily fall for this shit ? he actually believed that amayas background checks would miss an employees history of insanity ? and why are lily and her friend just laughing in the car after this stupid gag a day after her boyfriend died ?    forrest- i’m sorry but nick offerman is such an amazingly talented actor. but this role is so horribly written that i honestly can’t believe someone like alex garland made this show. why did he kill the russian boyfriend in the beginning ?  what indication are we given by the end of the show that he’s an evil person to do such an act ?  absolutely none. he’s shown to be sympathetic and grieving, and affected by loss. not even a hit that he would kill someone to keep devs a secret.  his cia security guy- i just don’t get his motivations at all, why did continue to live without any pain after getting stabbed in ep 2? why is he, an overweight older man so much stronger than jamie, a well built young dude ? why he did he kill jamie ? why did he feel bad they met at forrests home ? there are either no answers or very thinly written motivations to these questions.   the ending- if lily could so easily change the future, why didn’t anyone else even try? why didn’t katie try ? why didn’t lyndyn ?  the absolutely crazy stupid part- why did stewart kill forrest and lily ? wow this is horrible writing, he’s given no motivation for this.  —-edit to post because everyone’s replying telling me stewart did have motivation:- —-  stewart killing forrest and lily is just plain wrong, how is killing them going to stop the machine from getting into the hands of other people ? why didn’t he destroy the machine instead ?  i mean this literally didn’t work at all as seen at the end when katie with the senator, they both still have access to it.   i believe good narrative structural writing needs severe reasoning for a character to kill off other characters. this is a drastic step for anyone to take. stewart killing lily, someone who he literally just met ? lily by all means is completely innocent as far as stewart is concerned  stewart, by all indications is not someone who is  capable of this. there should have been “some” indication of this leading up to this point. but there isn’t. so the scene is just randomly there and motivation-less, just for some cheap shock value i guess ? idk  —- end edit ——  and the very anti climatic ending- forrest and lily dying and going into a simulation is frankly, terribly anti climactic and not triumphant in any way. it’s just plain dumb and hard to follow.   there are a million ways this show could have been better. for example: forrest as the protagonist would have been a million times more compelling than lily.  imagine a show about forrest, slowly descending into insanity while creating devs to get his daughter back and eventually killing people to make sure it works and is secret. we would see the lengths he would go to get her back it would make sense to see that fall to madness. it would play into the theme of him feeling like a messiah.   anyway, this show is a bummer. hope alex and team do better the next time.\n",

      " i'll keep this main post short and simple. this is how i've come to interpret the ending.  * free will does not exist and the universe is deterministic. * the many worlds model is correct. * the devs machine has never shown our world. * the devs machine has only shown worlds that are identical to our own, up until lily's decision. * nobody at devs would actually try to challenge a prediction, so they didn't. they are too fearful, fanatically devoted, etc., and lily is not. (this is a hard one to swallow but it's a tv show) * the devs machine is not designed to show worlds that are not identical to our own (unless it's programmed to, such as the mouse experiment). when it reaches the point of lily's decision, the machine can no longer say \"this is what happens\" and it becomes fuzzy because it's now looking at an intersection of multiple future branches and recognizes it's a significant loss of certainty that quickly falls to 0% (complete static). * forest thinks that devs has been showing us our world all along because that's what he wants to believe. he finally accepts that he's wrong when katie resurrects him within the system and reminds him of lyndon's principle. (another hard one to swallow, i think this realization could have been better emphasized) * stewart shuts the thing down because he listened to lyndon and didn't want forest to have all of that power. what kind of shenanigans would forest pull if he had lived? stewart didn't want to know. (kinda lame but whatever)  i'm not an expert on any of the technical stuff, and i haven't hyper-analyzed my theories but this is how it all seems to make some kind of sense to me haha. happy to expand on anything and hear your ideas.\n",

      " so this is my explanation on why the devs simulation predictions was failing after lily dies and i think it was caused by forest and not lily.  some people are saying it's because lily committed \"the original sin\" but the predictions actually went pass that point. remember, the whole devs system is a simulation and it's not actually directly coupled with what happens in real life. **the whole devs systems is running on data, making future predictions based on pass events, cause and effects**. lily throwing the gun out simply means the system couldn't predict that action, or lily actually made a choice, hence free will. but that's not what breaks the predictions.  when lily and forest were watching the predictions, it went pass the point where lily shoots forest, and ends at the point where lily dies. so whatever breaks the predictions happens after lily dies.  when lily and forest died, their consciousness was projected or uploaded into the **simulation** and when that happened, forest went back and stopped the car crash that killed his family and **this** **breaks the whole chain of cause and effects on which the simulation was working on**. so the simulation had no solid data on which to make another prediction, hence, failing.  so basically, the system was making predictions until the point where forest was uploaded into the simulation and changed previous data (saving his family).  edit: also, unrelated to this, stuart's was always the one that broke the vacuum seal and killed lily, even in the simulation.\n",

      " this might have been posted here in some shape or form but i couldn't find it said this way so here it goes.  simply put, what i gather from the finale (and i have to say i agree with it) is that determinism is still the basis of the universe but what we call free will is still possible thanks to the many worlds interpretation. this way, the paradox which i think the entire show is based upon, can be sidestepped. the paradox being that if the universe is deterministic and we find a way to use that and see into the future, we could simply do the opposite so it wouldn't be deterministic anymore. but, if we try and observe our own universe, the future will be fuzzy. in order to have a clear picture, we need to allow ourselves to observe from the multiverse and because of that, we will only see a universe in which everything that was predetermined will happen.  tl;tc (too long; too confusing): everything is predetermined, including an observation of the future using determinism. you can never observe your own universe because that's paradoxical so if you want to see the future you have to a) believe that there is a multiverse and b) accept that the universe you see will be as close as you can get. if something goes according to the prediction, you just haven't split branches yet.  none of this implies free will though. if you do something against the prediction, you were lead to do so by the act of having seen the prediction and that was caused by the events that preceded it.   i'm sorry. i know i haven't been really clear but i hope it makes some sense. and credit where credit is due, [this](https://reddit.com/r/devs/comments/g2s1sq/_/fnnns1e/?context=1) comment really got my thought process going.\n",

      " **general thoughts on the goal and the episode**   i'm not sure i get why the lily event would be necessary for what happened, there was an interview with the creator that mentioned that what did happen later on was what they wanted to i guess you could see it in the way that the people whom had seen the future needed for themselves to adhere to it in order to ensure the machine functioned as intended, we see up until the event, which is projected incorrectly and then we see the blur, i'm not sure why the machine would be showing that one event at all, but i guess for the shows sake it's to show that they went against the prediction.however seeing as what comes later was always the goal i don't see why they needed to adhere to the predictions and wait for this event when they could have just done it beforehand, albeit not wanting to not follow the prediction / projection, i don't see why they couldn't just do that and do what they intended i can't see how this event would be quintessential for that, seeing as this was planned, and then it happens in the \"fog\".   **on lily's \"decision\"**   however, it was earlier explained that what they see is either one of the universes or they can go through an infinitude and never be sure of seeing their one, it wasn't really explained. however this has me questioning their certainty over what she was going to do, as they effectively viewed one of the realities where stewart did what he did. the show did not explicitly say lily did it in all the universes, that could have been the case, otherwise forrest and katie's certainty of it is weird, but from what we saw it could be seen as no free will there and the common denominator of universes, where this happens of course, all universes don't have the machine, was stewart's action, which was predicted the same in what they looked at and what happened in their universe.     **some references**    [*https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/devs-creator-alex-garland-interview-980235/*](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/devs-creator-alex-garland-interview-980235/)[*https://www.reddit.com/r/devs/comments/g2rsa2/proof\\_lilys\\_choice\\_didnt\\_matter\\_explanation\\_in/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/devs/comments/g2rsa2/proof_lilys_choice_didnt_matter_explanation_in/)\n",

      " perhaps the most notorious of the strange features of the quantum world is the connection between the apparatus that we use to observe quantum events and the events under observation. in the quantum domain, the act of observation is inextricably linked with whatever is observed.  another important and controversial element of the quantum domain is a principle called non-locality. some of the experimental evidence suggests that subatomic particles that are separated at a distance from one another may be related or “entangled” so that what happens to one particle immediately affects or influences what happens to the other. this phenomenon is called non-locality because it does not seem to matter whether or not the particles are located near to one another. they can still be connected or related no matter how far apart they may be. what non-locality suggests is an underlying wholeness or deep connectivity within the basic fabric of physical reality.  an especially unusual version of the observer effect occurs in quantum mechanics, as best demonstrated by the double-slit experiment. physicists have found that even passive observation of quantum phenomena (by changing the test apparatus and passively 'ruling out' all but one possibility), can actually change the measured result. a particularly famous example is the 1998 weizmann experiment. despite the \"observer\" in this experiment being an electronic detector—possibly due to the assumption that the word \"observer\" implies a person—its results have led to the popular belief that a conscious mind can directly affect reality. the need for the \"observer\" to be conscious is not supported by scientific research, and has been pointed out as a misconception rooted in a poor understanding of the quantum wave function ψ and the quantum measurement process, apparently being the generation of information at its most basic level that produces the effect.\n",

      " so far this is the only hypothesis that explains everything about the ending in a way that makes logical sense to me. i'm not a religious person, but it does make logical sense. at first, i was confused/disappointed with the ending, but with this interpretation, i'm pretty satisfied with how things turned out.  **there is an external intervention (deus ex machina) to the reality**  the external entity could be either a god (which would explain the religious music and imagery in the show) or people/higher intelligence simulating our reality. for the sake of simplicity, i will refer to this entity as god in this post. the objective of the intervention was to save our reality from the machine. the divine intervention consisted of the following:  * **1. god made stuart kill forrest by deactivating the magnets** (this happens regardless of what lily does). the death of forrest and the ensuing investigation by the government effectively shuts down the machine's ability to predict the future accurately because the machine is no longer either in a faraday cage or in a vacuum seal (we see a bridge was built connecting the central cube to the outside world). it's only good for simulating forrest and lily's fake universe now.    * presumably, stuart saw the future using the machine and also saw that it couldn't predict beyond forrest's death. while watching the future, he must have been paying attention to himself (like most people do when watching a video of themselves) and realized his role in saving the world. coupled with the machine's inability to predict the future beyond that point, stuart might have taken that as god's message to him for what he should do. he didn't tell anyone what he realized and just waited outside the building to fulfill his role to kill forrest. * **2. god planted lily and her shooting of forrest as a red herring in the simulation** to distract forrest and katie from the true cause of forrest's death. planting lily as a red herring was necessary because if it wasn't for lily, forrest and katie would have realized stuart kills forrest. ~~knowing this, forest & katie might then have then tried to change the future.~~ if forrest and katie had foreseen stuart's sabotage, the events might have unfolded differently than we see in the show, making it more likely that the sabotage wouldn't actually take place. the safest way to ensure the sabotage took place was for forrest and katie to not know about it (more on this in comments below in this thread). so **lily was sacrificed as a red herring by the divine intervention so that stuart could safely carry out the sabotage of devs and save humanity from the machine.** this interpretation aligns with the final shot of lily dying on the floor: **she is in the same position as a crucified jesus, with arms outstretched to the sides.** divine music plays. * **3. god prevented the machine from simulating the future beyond forrest's death.** to make sure the red herring in point 2 worked, the divine intervention also prevented the machine from predicting anything beyond forrest's/lily's death. if the machine showed the rest of the future, katie and forrest would have probably eventually figured out that it was stuart who kills forest and then would have tried to change the future.    * this interpretation implies that the machine was physically perfectly capable of predicting the future beyond forest's death. it was just blocked by an external intervention (deus ex machina) from showing the prediction in order for the red herring to work.    * this makes more sense to me than lily's decision breaking the machine. if \"t\" is lily's gun throw moment and \"t + 10 is forrest's death\", i don't see any logical reason why lily's decision at time \"t\" (gun throw moment) would prevent the machine from being able to predict the \"t + 11\" future when predicting the future from time \"t - 10\".       * at \"t - 10\", the machine could have simply kept on predicting and showing the alternate future where lily shoots forrest. it could have kept on predicting \"t + 11\", \"t + 12\" etc to infinity. the fact that the machine couldn't do that means it was blocked from predicting beyond that point.  **another reason to believe that lily is god's proxy:**  after lily defies the machine's prediction, for a minute she becomes oddly calm and speaks as if in a trance (perhaps god speaking through her) and tells forrest he's not a real god. she says \"we've left your system... forrest, you know that thing about messiahs, don’t you. they’re false prophets.\" after that, fittingly, forrest goes on to live in a fake universe.  **edit:**  updated the part about how forrest and katie's knowledge of stuart's sabotage of devs might have affected the course of events.\n",

      " it drove me crazy that over thousands of years of recorded history, and even longer before that, lily was the only special one to make \"a choice\".  but now i am sure she didn't.  stewart was a long time (maybe from the start?) developer on the project. he had access to change the source code, and therefore the output the system displayed.  most others were too junior to notice, meanwhile katie and forrest were too preoccupied with their messiah complex to notice.  so, stewart saw the version where lily throws out the gun and he disables the magnetic field. but he tweaked the system to display an altered version (where she shoots forrest). why? cause he tried to misdirect katie and forrest. no, really why? cause it was pre-determined. everything stays on rails (including lily's actions)  but they all \"saw\" the end right from beginning, you say. remember: it was only recently that the system became fully online. it was very hard for them to get a clear picture before (and no sound). and the end result picture (with lily on the floor), is still same.   so the last question is: why couldn't the system see beyond that point (right from beginning). because after the incident, katie switched the system away from predicting our pre-determined reality to simulating the many-worlds universe of forrest and lily's \"afterlife\", and there is only so much memory the physical machine has (lyndon mentions it at one point).  remember the \"box inside the box\" problem. until katie does the switch, it's the \"mirror reflecting the opposite mirror\" scenario: infinite but predictable and rather repeatable. but once she switched the system to the \"afterlife\" simulation, the real (pre-determined) world machine couldn't keep up predicting itself simulating infinite many-world's in addition to predicting the reality\n",

      " warning: heavy spoilers ahead.  a quantum particle does not have a definitive state until it is \"observed\". the \"observation\" causes a [wave function collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wave_function_collapse) which means the particle assumes a definitive state.   the term \"observed\" here is a bit misleading, it doesn't mean human observation. in essence it means that the particle assumes a certain form based on probability matrix once it interacts with another particle. until the moment of interaction, the particle does not have a definitive form.  when the devs team scanned objects in the lab, down to the quantum level, they caused a wave function collapse in every particle within the objects. they then used the machine to extrapolate the state of all surrounding particles, which we see in the scene where the image expands until it engulfs forest's face.   they then expanded this extrapolation both in space and in time, until in terms of space it covered at least the earth-moon system, and in terms of time it went back at least a billion years (but when they tried to extrapolated forward in time, they couldn't get past the moment of lily's death).  however, they simply extrapolated the state of all non scanned quantum particles, they never measured them, which means they did not cause a wave function collapse in them. that means that those particles never actually assumed a definitive state. this is why the image was fuzzy. it showed all possible states based on each particle's probability matrix.  when extrapolating into the past, if we assume a deterministic universe, then there could have been only a single definitive \"past\" that happened, but when extrapolating backwards, you would inevitably get all the possible \"pasts\" that could have lead to the present moment.  when lyndon says that he \"threw it all away\" he essentially states that he filtered out all of the other \"pasts\" except one, presumably the most statistically likely one. that's why the image became clear.  that's also why forest ostensibly became so pissed (we know it's actually because of guilt for causing the death of his family, but that's not the explanation he gives to the team). he called it a \"neat party trick\", and in some sense he is right. lyndon is simply showing one possible extrapolation out of an infinite number of them. if you tweaked it a bit, you could in theory get an image of a completely different past that is completely absurd and unlikely, which forest alludes to when he says that they could also see a past where some south american country got to the moon instead of the us (among other bizarre things).  however if we take the multiverse theory into account, then there is no definitive past. all the possible pasts that could be extrapolated by the machine, actually did happen in a different timeline. an infinite number of \"pasts\" could have lead to the present (and of course there is also an infinite number of \"presents\" different from the one we currently occupy). there is also no definitive future, only a probability matrix of various futures extrapolated from the state of the present.  as we see in the scene where lyndon falls off the bridge, all probabilities lead to him falling, although the exact nature of the fall is different. the same is true for lily's death. the machine simply shows the most likely extrapolation (after applying lyndon's changes), or a very fuzzy image which is a superposition of all possible extrapolations (before applying lyndon's changes). in either case lily dies in the end and in a very similar manner.  (as a side note, i would explain forest's and katie's amazement at lily throwing away the gun, with their obsession with the deterministic universe. while the machine would have been able to predict it as one of the possible extrapolations, if the probability of that particular extrapolation was extremely unlikely, it wouldn't have been perceptible even in the fuzzy state before lyndon's changes, and certainly not afterwards)  there is really no definitive reason for why the machine was not able to predict beyond lily's death, and so abruptly. even if we assume that error accumulation was become too great at that point, it wouldn't have happened instantaneously. the image would have simply fuzzed out over a prolonged period of time. furthermore, with lyndon's changes it would have been able to predict for any period of time, it's just that it would have showed a prediction different to what actually happened.  the only way to reconcile that, would be by explaining that particular instance as a simulation in itself. the machine of a parent simulation simply never simulated the universe past that point, which is why the machine inside the simulation couldn't simulate beyond that point either (it was simply never allowed to, the simulation was turned off before it could \"get there\").  that would kinda explain the ending. the reason the simulation could not continue beyond lily's death, was because the purpose of the machine was fundamentally changed at that point, and that happened in all possible universes since lily dies in all of them in a very similar way. after lily's death, katie fundamentally changed the code of the machine, from trying to extrapolate the universe's past and future, into simply being a simulator which contains a copy of lily's and forest's consciousness and simulates a completely different universe which cant possibly exist in any of the previous extrapolations.  this was a bit long, but i think it provides a plausible explanation that ties the story together nicely.\n",

      " putting it generally, determinism looks at how one’s environment shapes their beliefs, personality, and whatnot. and by extension we don’t truly make decisions because our actions are partially, if not completely, products of our environment.   while there are several issues with how it’s presented in the show, the biggest one is that determinism is not rigid. if anything, determinism is about intervention. when it’s used in policy and research it’s about making estimates about likely outcomes for individuals based on certain variables and then responding by trying to mitigate certain risk factors. for example, if we know that certain factors may negatively impact one’s educational performance than we could try to offset those factors or remove them from someone’s life. or if someone learned to be racist than meaningful and purposeful exposure to different types of people or ideas may change those beliefs. basically, certain variables can shape people’s actions or beliefs, but it’s also true that introducing new variables can change those outcomes. it’s never an exact science though since behavior is really complex and any number of factors can push someone in a particular direction.  all the main “determinists” in this show are a bunch of jaded sad sacks who just accept anything that comes their way. they’re fatalist, if anything, because they don’t believe that things will change no matter what. if determinists could actually see into the future or predict outcomes with total certainty, their job would be about understanding what factors led to that conclusion and what different factors may change it. in fact, just knowing the outcome is a factor that could and probably wild impact the outcome.  regardless, the show cates more about it’s strange thriller plot line than it does about its philosophy and themes it throws i occasionally.\n",

      " i recently read \"ishmael\" and “the story of b”, novels encapsulating the author's thoughts on modern-day civilization as an ongoing attempt to become independent from nature, putting man at odds with nature and resulting in ecological imbalance. some of the statements in the books seemed to parallel the actions and thoughts of characters in devs. this is not an essay, but just observations and quotes from both books in connection with the series.  forest noted curiously how the early people of humanity had remained culturally, intellectually, and technologically the same for so long, and just the last ten thousand years it all changed so much. he does not make much of a conclusion. this relates to one of the foundations of quinn’s thoughts: that modern culture was founded on the mistaken idea that “man” arrived at the advent of the agricultural revolution.  > it staggers the imagination to wonder what the foundation thinkers of our culture would have written if they’d known that humans had lived perfectly well on this planet for millions of years without agriculture or civilization, if they’d known that agriculture and civilization were not innate to humans… but here is one of the most amazing occurrences in all of human history. when the thinkers of the 18th, 19th, 20th centuries were finally compelled to admit that the entire structure of thought in our culture had been built on a profoundly important error, absolutely nothing happened. [story of b]  rather than hoping for authorial intent, i would like to connect forest’s lack of thought about the pre-neolithic people as a reflection on modern culture in the eyes of quinn: modern civilization saw a world-shaking truth that humans didn’t have to be where they are now, but chose it like an animal swept along in a stampede moving towards a cliff. watching devs, we may see something fundamentally wrong with people’s passive reactions to determinism, but:  > even if you privately thought the whole thing was madness, you had to play your part, you had to take your place in the story. [ishmael]  regardless of whether determinism is real or not, if we approach devs as an exploration of faith in a system—in this case, the system of modern civilization—we see that forest, katie, and the followers of devs *interpret* the visuals of devs as a type of prophecy of destruction resulting from lily’s entrance into the facility. this is why forest calls himself a messiah by the finale: devs is a construct of god—not the christian god, but the god of civilization. forest is a prophet for modern civilization, which believes that its people are powerless to stop itself from destruction, as they have seen it on the devs projection.  > one of the most striking features of [modern] culture is its passionate and unwavering dependence on prophets. the influence of people like moses, buddha, confucius, jesus, and muhammad in history has been enormous… what were the prophets trying to accomplish here? [story of b]  quinn’s protagonist arrives at this answer: “they were here to straighten us out and tell us how we ought to live.”  what’s interesting about forest and katie’s perspective on devs is that because they see the step-by-step way people are going to live, they do not have to resort to *ought*, but *how* they’ll live. the *ought* is implied and irrelevant because in this civilization, there is no question where the end result is, which is the culmination of civilization. when the writing is on the wall for the supposed end of life as we know it, forest and katie’s method of “salvation” is to do nothing but wait. i would think that there’s a relief in knowing that there’s nothing they can do to stop impending doom.  > the people of our culture are used to bad news and are fully prepared for bad news, and no one would think for a moment of denouncing me if i stood up and proclaimed that we’re all doomed and damned. [story of b]  this is why i think that forest’s statement that “i don’t think about the environment” is a bald-faced admission that his exposure to the machinations of his own culture has resulted in the conclusion that he must serve only himself as the end result of civilization will all be the same anyway: destruction.  > as far as these religions have it worked out, if you fail of salvation, then your failure is complete, whether others succeed or not. on the other hand, if you find salvation, then your success complete—again, whether others succeed or not. ultimately, as these religions have it, if you’re saved, then literally nothing else in the entire universe matters. your salvation is what matters. nothing else—not even my salvation (except of course, to me). this was a new vision of what counts in the world. forget the boiling frog, forget the pain. nothing matters but you and your salvation.  and here we arrive at forest’s relationship with stewart. /u/emf1200 [has a great interpretation](https://www.reddit.com/r/devs/comments/g33dps/we_need_to_talk_about_stewart/fnq0ird/) of stewart’s motivations within devs, which was to use it as an archaeological tool to understand past to better our future. but:  > stewart's biggest issue with forest is his lack of interest in the past. stewart isn't mad that forest doesn't know anything about the past, he's upset that forest isn't even curious about it. forest won't even guess the name of the poet that stewart recited. and the fact that forest doesn't know isn't the issue, the issue is that he doesn't care. if forest is not motivated by curiosity to learn about the past than stewart must realize the whole devs project isn't a selfless act of historical exploration. it's a selfish quest for personal control of the past, present, and future.  quinn’s characters consider this type of behavior by contrasting it with another culture:  > this is interesting. i’ve never noticed this before… leaver peoples are always conscious of having a tradition that goes back to very ancient times. we have no such consciousness. for the most part, we’re a very ‘new’ people. every generation is somehow new, more thoroughly cut off from the past than the one that came before.  > what does mother culture have to say about this?  > ah. mother culture says that this is as it should be there’s nothing in the past for us. the past is dreck. the past is something to be put behind us, something to be escaped from.  > so you see: this is how you came to be cultural amnesiacs.  validated by devs in his perpetuating of modern civilization, forest succumbs to irrational self-interest: that his own salvation is at the mutual exclusivity of others. this is why sergei and jamie were fair game to kill. they challenged forest’s perception of how the world worked; devs said that they should be dead at a certain moment, and so forest made it so.  > something really weird must have happened to turn these people into murderers. what could it have been? wait a second… look at how these people live. they’re not just saying that *we* have to die. they’re saying, “what we want to live lives and what we want to die dies.”  > that’s it! they’re acting as if they were the gods themselves. they’re acting as if they eat at the gods’ own tree of wisdom, as thugh they were as wise as the gods and could send life and death wherever they please. [ishmael]  so with quinn’s vision of the world, we are as a forest looking passively at our modern civilization, faithfully believing that there is no choice except to take our part in the story of progress, even though we see at every step of the way we are willfully forgetting the past and becoming captive to a tram line of self-destruction. and when a character like lily finally shows that this story has been self-perpetuated all along, we can finally look to other ways of life that are not stuck on such destructive tram lines.  however, i don’t think that this show had these parallels in mind, so i don’t really have a way to connect the conclusion of devs with the thoughts of quinn. but i hope that it shows that devs is a subtle enough show to bring on these kinds of interpretations!  p.s. also saw one statement that connected well with the ending actually:  > adam and eve spent three million years in the garden, living on the bounty of the gods, and their growth was very modest; in the leaver life-style this is the way it *has* to be. like leavers everywhere, they had no need to exercise the gods’ prerogative of deciding who shall live and who shall die. but when eve presented adam with this knowledge, he said, ‘yes, i see; with this, we no longer have to depend on the bounty of the gods. with the matter of who shall live and who shall die in our own hands, we can create a bounty that will exist for us alone, and this means i can say yes to life, and grow without limit.’ [ishmael]  if lily’s action was like the original sin, choice, then lily gave forest the knowledge that choice is possible. forest decides take a chance on choice by risking his consciousness to be delivered into a simulation that could turn out great or horribly (i still don’t understand how that works, but ah well). but by doing this, he has put life and death back into his own hands by resurrecting himself and lily (dunno if that lyndon is our lyndon). but at least he now believes in a culture that was founded in a diversity of “existences”, which means he is not tied so fanatically to his god-like conception of monolithic determinism. it’s a rough interpretation, but maybe it could work.  > so. now we have a clearer idea what this story is all about: *the world was made for man, and man was made to rule it.* [ishmael]\n",

(it's supposed to say 2., but for some reason it says 1.) the simulation inside the machine has limitations because of limited processing power. anyone who tries to build their own quantum computer will be confused because they can't come up with any reasons why it doesn't work. and it is restricted to the city of san francisco. despite having a moon, sun and stars on the sky, the rest of the universe doesn't exist. anyone who tries to leave san francisco will find themselves unable to do so. what will happens when the humans inside it find out they are stuck there for some unexplained reason?\n",

      " the key to understanding what happened is lyndon's decision to use everett's many worlds interpretation.   forest was furious with lyndon because when he used everett's mw interpretation to filter out all but one of the pasts he was trying to listen to, it became all but certain the jesus they were hearing was not the jesus from their past. (there are infinite jesuses according to the mwi, so the odds of it being the jesus from their past is something like 1/infinity. that's small.) let's assume for the sake of argument and simplicity that the only difference was a single hair on jesus's head.    eventually, we see forest's concerns were legitimate: using the mwi to clarify the images/sounds leads to a divergence when lily doesn't shoot forest. no matter how accurately deus has predicted their future *so far*, it is still imperfect, because it is extrapolating a specific past's future -- the future that resulted from a past where nothing is different except a single hair on jesus's head. in that world, lily shoots forest. deus was always showing them what happens in that world.   put another way: deus was a glimpse into a *different reality*. it wasn't broken. it just didn't quite do what forest wanted it to do. that's why he was so mad at lyndon.   i see no contradiction.     additionally, for the sake of a more complete argument, many other things can be wildly different between the deus sim and the devs team's \"reality.\" as long as the devs team can't compare the computer's output to some other, perfect historical record of an event, it can't see the divergences.\n",

      " i love the big wide shots we get of the devs building's exterior and interior. it's very meditative and it got me noticing the similarities between the devs building construction and the construction of the hebrew tabernacle.  for those who aren't familiar, in the hebrew scriptures, it's recorded that god (yhwh) instructed the israelites to build him a dwelling place or a home. this is where the ark of the covenant resides. it's basically a fancy tent with lots of gates and curtains and ornamentation. this is an illustration of what it might have looked like based off the many many descriptions of it's construction details in the book of exodus:  https://preview.redd.it/1nd5fsb5f2u41.jpg?width=1237&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1eb20a257031ce822bc1ddc298e6780a6b742516  i'm sure you notice the similarities to alex garland's devs building:  https://preview.redd.it/e55iyebif2u41.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed542ea56f26625ff7f86aeed833d0863f7d1b6e  even when he first introduced sergei to the building, his dialogue reminded me a lot of the exodus passages where yhwh lays out the specific dimensions and materials needed for the tabernacle.  >“a lead faraday shield, a 13 yard thick concrete shell, then a gold mesh. then an eight yard vacuum seal, totally unbroken. then the labs, and in the core, the machine.”  the interior of the tabernacle was supposed to be filled with gold. exodus 37:  >bezalel made the ark of acacia wood—two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.**2** he overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it. **3** he cast four gold rings for it and fastened them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two rings on the other.  [ rendering of what the interior may have looked like](https://preview.redd.it/pkcu93qxg2u41.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe23d8e506d2bec776eea52c05e733f564b0f825)  [the deus machine ](https://preview.redd.it/78mb9y6yg2u41.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=267f6cd76fc2d6e012af7471979bdb5ebb3915f0)  obviously the hebrew scriptures and christian scriptures are woven throughout this whole story, and i think this is one big way that garland used that symbolism to great effect.  let me know if you noticed any other similarities!\n",

      " **spoiler warning for the last episode (8) of devs**     **summary:** the world is in fact deterministic in the tv series devs and the computer simulation could successfully model it. the \"head shot\" prediction that forest and katie believe was actually planted by stewart, and the model actually predicted him killing lily and forest.   \\*\\* i know, it’s a dubious, but hear me out \\*\\*   firstly, what we know about stewart.   · stewart is a senior developer at devs  · he tells lyndon that forest will kill to keep the project going  · clearly thinks forest is dangerous and likely the whole project in dangerous for humanity  · stewart has high level access, including emergency codes       so, scene 1 (see below) is where i'm going to start. here we see other developers coming to the realisation that the simulation is not joyous once working successfully but disturbing. stewart seems to have already come to this conclusion and has a developed understanding of why. i think this shows that he is already, and may have even been for a while, in the state of mind that devs is bad for humanity and should ultimately be destroyed.   scene 2 we see stewart to confront forest, clearly questioning his leadership and ultimately questioning if such an important device should be put in the hands of those who haven't learnt from the past. also, worth noting, i assume we are all in agreement that stewart was aware of the future prediction being limited to the time of lily's supposed choice.   scene 3 we again see stewart acknowledging that devs is bad but also crucially reference determinism with the quote “well if you can’t, you can’t. that is the truth.”. this is key, because of the next part of my argument.   scene 4: when we see lily toss the gun out of the capsule both katie and forest have had their beliefs shattered, determinism, and act accordingly. stewart on the other hand is calm and does either not appreciate the ramifications or does not believe them. we then see stewart do something very unexpected by killing lily and forest and responding to katie by saying “because i realised what we had done. someone had to stop this. don’t blame me, katie. it was **predetermined**.”  bingo, so stewart clearly still believes in a deterministic universe and yet is not shocked like katie and forest by lily's choice. could he have a different idea of what the deterministic outcome should have been. is it possible that stewart, at realising the path they were heading down, was able to plant the projected future katie and forest see, knowing it would bring the demise of devs.   if the machine correctly predicted the future then katie would take it forward, knowing it was a success. this goes against stewarts belief clearly that it is bad for humanity. as a senior developer, could he have the power and foresight to alter a projection which katie and forest would then see (the gun shot one) and enact the real one of him killing lily and forest.   i think this helps explain stewarts very odd behaviour in the last two episodes but it’s just a theory.   let me know your thoughts on these ramblings. i'm likely to have missed something as i only finished the series 2 hours ago.  cheers         **scene 1**  stewart and other develops look at the latest breakthrough and end up doing a very short prediction of themselves.  another dev: “why don’t i feel good about it?”  stewart: “that would be your unconscious mind speaking to you and what’s saying to you is uh-oh…”   **scene 2**  stewart confronts forest upon entering the dev centre. note at this point it is clear stewart knows something is coming up, clearly indicating his knowledge of future events.   stewart: “you know, forest, i don’t mind that you don’t know who i was quoting, but i do mind that you can’t even guess. such big decisions about our future, by people who know so little about our past.”  forest: “isn’t knowing our past exactly what we’re doing here?”  stewart: “no, it isn’t”  note: i’m not sure of the relevance of the mark antony quote or the line “forest, who was mark antony? guess…guess.” any help?   **scene 3**  first key bit  lily meets stewart upon entering the devs centre for the first time.  stewart: “this place will not be good for you. it’s not good for anybody”  second key bit  lily: “i don’t think i can turn around”  stewart: “well if you can’t, you can’t. that is the truth.”   **scene 4**  following on from lily throwing out the gun from the lift, stewart disengages the magnetic forces holding up the lift, sending both lily and forest to their deaths.   “what did you do?”  “i disabled the electromagnetic field system on the capsule”  why?  “because i realised what we had done. someone had to stop this. don’t blame me, katie. it was predetermined.”  note how calm and calculated stewart is here… almost as if he has seen it all before in a simulation\n",

      " simply put, there is little chance an encryption specialist would have an issue with the concept of deterministic nature of the universe.  somewhere around your first year in university or maybe earlier, a concept of pseudorandom number generator is introduced. you then learn the nature of the pseudo-, if you haven't before.  this is a basic it thing, not necessarily related to encryption. every computation is deterministic (depends on the initial conditions, like in an equation), so you need a source of entropy (chaos) to generate a *sufficiently* (not *truly*) random number. it could be a fluctuation in your cooler's fan speed, or a pre-recorded portion of your cursor movement or some electric noise in the circuits. if you're on a linux or a mac machine, typing `cat /dev/random` into the terminal will show you a stream generated from things like that. a lot of things crypto- then tap into that and the likes of it.  so no, determinism is not just a part of some optional philosophy 101 you can miss being too hungover to attend. it is a central principal and a technical reality. no one capable to argue about viability of elliptic curves will sit dumbfounded by the simple notion of causality, staring at a pen.  otherwise, i absolutely loved the show.\n",

      " this documentary is fantastic! it's less than an hour and i think everyone who loves the mind bending physics parts of devs would love this.  hugh everett is the man who put forward the many-worlds theory in the 50's which is now one of the major competing interpretations on what is going on with quantum mechanics, as we heard about in the show. this theory only started picking up prominence late in his life, and much more after he died. during his life, the idea was shot down by none other than neils bohr because bohr had a horse in the race with his own theory of course.  the best part of this doc is the angle it is told from. his son mark is a famous indie-rock musician and frontman of the eels who didn't really know his emotionally distant father and is terrible at math himself. his dad died when he was 18 (he found him and said grabbing him to see if he was alive was the only time he could remember touching his father).  so he didn't really know the man and had no idea he was a genius physicist until after he died.  you'll learn the context of where the theory came from and what it means with pretty good explanations, as well as get a fascinating family journey as part of the story (plus great soundtrack of eels songs). highly recommend!  find here on [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/58603054), youtube right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8phbdfsnvtq), and pbs page with additional links about the man (including his thesis where you puts forward the many-worlds theory) right [here](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/manyworlds/).  edit: it's from 2007 btw\n",

      " seems like anyone who speaks up about a flaw in this show gets downvoted to oblivion. maybe this can be a post where people can actually talk about where this show went wrong  1. the acting and cast  the cast is pretty bad. they made the bodyguard of the biggest company on earth the least intimidating character on the show. could they really not get anyone in decent health to play this role? the dude looks like he needs a break after walking up one flight of stairs  lily is a terrible actor. i know she is mostly liked here but wow... some scenes were hard to get through because of her acting. and no, i don’t think this was done on purpose at all. just cringe and terrible. sleep in my bed.   forest is the only good actor and role imo.   kind of going into my opinion here but stewart looks like the exact opposite of a software engineer. his character and personality just felt out of place.   katie looks like a knock off kristen bell. i couldn’t take her seriously because her face constantly looked like she was trying to smile but was also in pain  2. the biggest flaw about this show was the pace  so. fucking. slow. this is so unlike alex garland. in ex machina, no line or shot was wasted. everything was deliberate and the pace was great. annhilation was a little slower but at least it flowed. devs felt like there was a pause between every line. and so many unnecessary lines  the plot also barely moves forward. this show could’ve been 4 episodes without all the unnecessary fluff. why do characters talk so unnaturally? like i’m watching on .75x speed? was alex garland makin episodes for 30 minute time frames and then suddenly decided to make them an hour at the last second?   3. the premise and the computer  this was the only thing keeping me watching. it’s incredibly interesting and an ambitious concept. the computer, the building, it was all portrayed well and beautifully  4. random things done badly  jamie and lily’s first conversation is so badly executed. jamie is like “well lily, let me summarize everything that happened in the past 2 years to give the audience exposition and context...”. lazy writing  why did we have a “surprise reveal” of what we already knew? that sergei was murdered?  kenton in the bathroom with jamie... wow this was hard to watch. the dude is 70 years old. jamie is in his physical prime. and jamie just... sits in the bathtub and waits there. wtf?  it was that easy to break out of the psych ward? just open the window and go? i know lily was drugged but i feel like she could’ve very easily done this herself when she first arrived, before she was drugged, after the drugs wore off.   i’m in love with you too.   sleep in my bed.   kenton watching from his car and seeing jaimie and forest playing frisbee and throwing a hissy fit... wtf? am i watching an elementary school drama show? bad writing again  this show is just too on the nose sometimes. just be more subtle like the other two movies. “you were counting in russian”.  “the v is a u. deus. it means deus. it’s god.” yeah real subtle there  they simulation stopped because lily made a choice. but it didn’t stop until like a minute after the “choice”. and why didn’t anyone else make a choice? especially when seeing a projection 1 second into the future? that was stupid and made determinism seem stupid too  the conversation lily had with katie about randomness was insulting to the audience’s intelligence. lily is a very intelligent engineer and the best thing she can think of is a coin flip or lightning? somethings truly are random. dna mutating. whether or not carbon decays at a given time. the collapse of a wave function.   ok i’m being nit picky at this point but my biggest gripe about this show was how slow it was. no one talks about it on here but the pace is so bad. the plot inches forward like a snail. there are too many pauses and unnecessary and unnatural lines. it felt like a pain to get through with a barely rewarding conclusion. the cast was pretty glaringly bad but i guess i could’ve looked past that if it wasn’t so slow\n",

      " i watched the entire season of devs in 3 days. at first i thought it was intriguing. i still like the concept but there were a couple of visual problems that i had with the show that undermined the shows credibility for me. so let's get to it. please chime in with your thoughts:  1. the quantum computer - this was the first major problem i had. the quantum computer is capable of distilling the universe down to matters of cause and effect. how mind blowing is that? so wouldn't you think that the quantum computer would be an incredibly impressive machine? the unveiling of the devs laboratory was indeed quite impressive. the amber glow in the central chamber. the floating elevator. even the building with the reflective pool on top was pretty amazing. yet, when sergei first enters the laboratory he circles around the quantum computer taking in it's scale, it's presence, it's artistry. sergei was in awe and i said, \"really?\" that thing looks like a bunch of wires and tubing from home depot. at best it reminded me of a sarah sze sculpture except her work is not really a fair comparison. so what could have been done to make the quantum computer look like a quantum computer?    (check out the comments section. the devs computer is based on a real quantum computer so i got schooled. i still think is could've been more other worldly but it's not the deal breaker like point #2.)    several things. how about covering the contraption with green screen so that the effects department could spiff up the final visual? make it glow. make it do something else. instead we got 70's era looking spinning antennae. i loved the idea of the quantum computer as the central nervous system in the lab. it's location was great. it's the construction that sucked. the other thing that could have been done is make a tower of boxes. give them a high-tech look befitting the slick futuristic laboratory. at least they would look believable. as shown, the quantum computer didn't work for me. it almost made the dev lab look like a cheap set design and undermined the credibility of the show.  2. the projection screen - the projection screen was simply awful. without a doubt i couldn't get past how amateurish this prop was conceived. it was so silly looking i could not concentrate on anything else in the show. i didn't care about lily. i didn't care about the de brogile-bohm or everett's many-worlds theory. i was like, \"what the hell happened with the tv?\" when the projection screen was just static i could wrap my head around it. i asked myself, could someone put their arm through the static. if so, what would happen? was the projection screen 2d or 3d? all interesting questions and an intriguing mystery. then when lyndon solved the static issue and we could clearly see jesus's crucifixion i almost quit watching the show. remember, at least at the beginning of the show, the purpose of the quantum computer was to reconstruct real time. and then, finally, this grand unveiling of jesus really dying on the cross. it wasn't supposed to be a video of jesus dying on the cross. it was the actual jesus dying on the cross. then why did it look like a video? there was only one point of view and that point of view was through the lens of a camera, not an actual event that really happened 2,000 years ago. also, why was the projection in 2d? it looked like a giant tv with barely 1080p resolution. what, forest created a quantum computer that can see backwards and forwards in time and yet he bought his tv from costco? why wasn't the projection in 3d? why wasn't the projection a hologram? even now our feeble laptops can use 3d apps where you could walk into a room and check it out from different points of view. nope. watching the crucifixion was like watching casablana at mann's chinese theater. there was one point of view and one camera angle. forest's daughter was backlit blowing bubbles in side view, not once, not twice, but over and over again. why didn't the show set up these scenes inside a 360º camera chamber to capture every angle and every point of view? this way when the devs programmers watched an event on the projection screen it would look and \"feel\" real. maybe the programmers could have stepped into a hologram and experience these events as real events in real time. if star trek could do it why couldn't devs in 2020 do it? history was not lived in 2 dimensions. real life is not lived in 2 dimensions. the projection screen simply looked fake. it almost ruined the show for me.\n",

      " so i just finished watching the show and i got to give it to alex garland for his style alone. he is an amazing director and i can't wait to absorb anything and everything he makes in the future (potentially a halo movie?) but in saying that, i want to talk about some issues i have with the philosophies of the show.  determinism is likely in my opinion what the truth of reality is, not the multiverse theory, and it really comes down to the fact that we can't see the future because if we did we could do it differently. it's hard to think about but one could accurately predict the future inside a closed system, but not outside of it due to unknown variables. the earth is more complicated than just what happens inside of it because it's not a closed system. there are solar waves and asteroids and countless other things that affect it. if the earth was a closed system than with the right computers, we could accurately predict every person's actions due to the past. the issue lies in the fact that we would need to know every atom in the entire universe to accurately predict people or a person and their choices. not only does red-shift make that impossible (the universe moving away in every direction faster than light) but that we would need a computing entity like the size of the galaxy to process it.  so the thought experiment stays that if we could accurately predict the future, we could do it differently, thus making the multiverse theory correct, but we simply can't compute it, so the future remains unpredictable and fixed.  i would love counters to this train of thought and for those that respond, it be an honest conversation. thank you to everyone who read.\n",

      " apologies if this has been posted already but wanted to share the full text of the poem stewart recites (mistakenly identified later as shakespeare) as it strikes me as an important way to understand the show (but also just super profound):  aubade by philip larkin  i work all day, and get half-drunk at night.    waking at four to soundless dark, i stare.    in time the curtain-edges will grow light.    till then i see what’s really always there:    unresting death, a whole day nearer now,    making all thought impossible but how    and where and when i shall myself die.    arid interrogation: yet the dread of dying, and being dead, flashes afresh to hold and horrify.  the mind blanks at the glare. not in remorse    —the good not done, the love not given, time    torn off unused—nor wretchedly because    an only life can take so long to climb clear of its wrong beginnings, and may never;    but at the total emptiness for ever, the sure extinction that we travel to and shall be lost in always. not to be here,    not to be anywhere, and soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.  this is a special way of being afraid no trick dispels. religion used to try, that vast moth-eaten musical brocade created to pretend we never die, and specious stuff that says no rational being can fear a thing it will not feel, not seeing that this is what we fear—no sight, no sound,    no touch or taste or smell, nothing to think with,    nothing to love or link with, the anaesthetic from which none come round.  and so it stays just on the edge of vision,    a small unfocused blur, a standing chill    that slows each impulse down to indecision.    most things may never happen: this one will,    and realisation of it rages out in furnace-fear when we are caught without    people or drink. courage is no good: it means not scaring others. being brave    lets no one off the grave. death is no different whined at than withstood.  slowly light strengthens, and the room takes shape.    it stands plain as a wardrobe, what we know,    have always known, know that we can’t escape,    yet can’t accept. one side will have to go. meanwhile telephones crouch, getting ready to ring    in locked-up offices, and all the uncaring intricate rented world begins to rouse. the sky is white as clay, with no sun. work has to be done. postmen like doctors go from house to house.\n",

      " i've been stuck on this because i thought that the last episode would make a huge deal about this, but i haven't seen it much in any interviews or posts here. i was kind of waiting for this big argument about the copenhagen interpretation and how it pertains to the conversations at the end, but nowhere did they even tie it all together with this theory:  the interpretation, in my wiki-research, suggests that only when observed do particles act in ways that are predictable. same thing applies to humans in devs. with the machine observing all of humankind, people who know they are being observed (or maybe everybody even if they don't know) will act according as observed and cannot deviate from the path, which was discussed in the double slit experiment in that one episode at the university.  however, lily breaks that code, proving that quantum mechanics cannot govern our actions in spite of being observed, but her conversation prior with forest seems to indicate that they are doing whatever it is whether or not they feel like it because they are being observed by the system.  after lily dies, they convert the system into the sims and thus are not using it any longer to observe humanity, and thus free will becomes reinstated in the world. this might not be as interesting, and everybody might already know this, but i just wanted to see if i am totally off base and totally missed the point here.\n",

      " just finished devs a few minutes ago. i found the ending of the show really disappointing honestly, i liked first half of the episode but the last half ruined it for me. however i think this is due to two things, one is the show westworld and the other is guessing everything.   devs and westworld season 3 both deal with the idea of free will and i think to me it was really depressing to see in devs that idea that there was no free will at all which makes the ending kind of annoying to me. westworld season 3 deals with the idea of free will but more of the idea that there is hope, since it deals with ai.  the other reason is that since i am an avid science fiction fan i guessed almost everything that was going to be big reveals. the whole prediction with the devs system, the fact that their in a simulation at the end, and the fact that lily would end up creating the discrepancy.  &#x200b;  now, the big thing that made the ending disappointing for me was the whole lily deciding to throw the gun. i was expecting that to happen and when it did i was hoping something different would happen. overall while i think the story was good especially the first 4 episodes and episode 7, episodes 5 and 6 were ah, i don't think i will watch the show again as i feel let down now by the ending.\n",

      " in this post i wanted to share some observations on how i think this story is a moralistic story about determinism that we need to start talking about in society. science is showing us that we don't have free will. this is pretty much a given now, but this show shows us exactly what problems that leads to.  we don't have free will and all we know about physics, chemistry, biology tells us the same. all of these sciences provide us with models that allow us to make predictions of what will happen in the future in certain scenarios. these work out. the science is solid. so we know that we also don't have free will.  however, the problem is, if you know that you don't have free will, it can lead to passivity, it can make people angry and more aggressive (this is the outcome of actual psychological research pertaining to free will). this is exactly what we are shown in the show: people \"believe\" the machine. the machine becomes a sort of false prophet. people believe it and stay stuck in the tram lines.  the main takeaway for me was the fact that we need to truly understand what determinism means for our will, and what part of it is free, and what part isn't. the show clearly showed that forest and katie were pretty fatalistic: the machine predicts so it happens. basically they believe it so it happens. these are the tram lines we're stuck in. it's a form of self-fulfilling prophecy. everyone kept making that same mistake except lily.  and that is the point. we live in a world that we know is deterministic. we know that our will is not actually free. but we are still in control in the now. we still make choices. i am the person making a choice, using my brain, all of my nerve inputs (sight, smell, impulses signaling thirst); and i determine what to do next. my brain is a complex machine \"computing\" all of these things enabling me to make a choice. that choice is completely free, for all intents and purposes, until i make it.  after i make the choice it turns out that it wasn't free. the choice i made was the only one i could possibly make because all of the sensory inputs combined with my brain (and its memories, experiences and wiring in general) would always lead to the choice that i made. however before i make it, all of these things haven't come together yet. the input to make the calculation isn't yet present. and in real life it cannot be easily simulated (e.g. cosmic rays traveling at near light speed influence life on earth, and you cannot predict from where and when they come unless you simulate the whole universe).  funny enough a lot of decisions we make are dependent on our predictions of the future. i'm hungry so i walk to the fridge to get something. in a way i predict that if i go and eat something, this will fix my hunger. we constantly do this. every single thing we do is based on predictions of the future. think about it, it's insane, we try and predict the future constantly throughout the day. but after we predict and make a decision or take an action based on a prediction, it immediately becomes the only thing we could have done. usually we try and make the best decision we can with the limited information we have available. we try and do the right thing but because our predictions are often flawed, we often fail at this. in hindsight, we couldn't have done anything differently, but when looking at the future we are in full control.  this realization of all of this is profound: we are fully responsible for the future we create. even though we know we have no free will, we need to own this reality, realizing that we have a future that we can determine. the future is not pre-determined. we create the future constantly, together. using a fatalistic mindset is dangerous and exactly this is the point the show is trying to make.  mindset is something we carry with us when planning and making decisions. thinking we don't have any influence will change psychological(!) processes in our brain leading to different decisions (already proven by psychological research). however in the past in society we have often seen that acquiring a better understanding of our reality leads to us being able to make better decisions. this is what we need to do: accept the fact that we don't have free will but use that information to make ourselves, our lives, other people's lives and our societies better.  science has shown us how reality works. now we need to own it.\n",

      " a lot of the show was talking about how free will is an illusion but also that the idea of a multiverse was apparent. this is somewhat contradictory imo. your own path (and everyone and thing else's) within the set universe you live in being predetermined would make you think there is no free will. however, the multiverse would in and of itself create free will. every decision ever made branches off into infinite realities. every single choice has its own conclusion multiplied infinitely. the most delicately intricate tree of existence(s) incomprehensible by the human mind. thus, while the path of existence is determined in your own reality outside the construct of time, it is because of the set of free willed decisions that were made within your own existence stitched within the multiverse. so the multiverse is itself freewill. with infinite conclusions, each reality within the multiverse is its own holistic choice.  so while it might seem like, given a predetermined path, there is no such thing as free will, if there are indeed infinite realities each singular reality as a whole would be its own unique set of circumstances and in turn; choices. free will.  forest was dead set on free will being an illusion because he rejected the notion of the multiverse and thus never incorporated those ramifications into his worldview. if there were a single universe that was proved to be predetermined, then free will would indeed be an illusion. this is however not the case.  tl;dr the multiverse in and of itself is free will. with infitinte realities, each reality is holistically and uniquely its own choice.\n",

      " just finished watching the series, super thought provoking and was on the edge of my seat (sofa?) the whole time.  i have a theory / question, is deus simply having similar limitations to what sergei did at the start on his laptop with the nematode worm, but at billion dollars scale? at the point of initiating and coupling the worm's movements, the ai is able to predict the future of the worm for 30 seconds, after which the simulation fails. at the moment the dead mouse has been fully studied and \"outwardly extrapolated\" by deus, they seemingly were able to look as far back in the past as possible, but only a few months in advance. i don't believe the show suggested they had extrapolated again since the initial dead mouse, this was shown repeatedly, different objects were tried, until the mouse when it finally worked, which could be argued as the last time they truly \"looked\".  in the subsequent months of work, they merely improved on interpreting the data from the mouse, they were able to clean up the images, have better sounds, but the point of initial extrapolated is constant, the dead mouse, therefore how far they could look in the future is fixed. from the show, this was months, which became weeks, days, 21 hours, and then, like the worm prediction, a small decoupling is followed by the entire system being unusable, where the prediction bears zero resemblance to reality, instead of a bunch of points and lines not lining up with a worm, it's white noise on the screen.  lyndon uses data from \"multiple universes\" to fill in the gaps to make the sound / images more crisp, like how your google / apple smartphone uses your shaky hand to gather extra information to produce a cleaner / brighter image, giving you the illusion the phone can see what's in the dark, when in fact it's making a very... educated guess based on a lot of similar images, but these lunatics, being deep in the cult that they created, believed that lilly did something that broke the universe because they were so sure their system works, when in fact it's just a scaled up version of the limitation behind sergei's worm model. if they looked elsewhere in a different part of the world at that moment, perhaps a child drops an ice cream cone instead of eating it, somewhere else rained instead of snowed, and here, lilly tossed the gun instead of shooting it.\n",

      " first, the truth of the many worlds interpretation is established within the show and even used as a plot point, yet none of the devs team acknowledges that the future they see is only one of trillions of futures. you can argue that maybe forest still rules out many worlds in spite of its success in devs but clearly katie subscribes to the interpretation.  second, while of course the devs machine is, in practice, impossible, it is also in principle impossible, both [mathematically](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/limits-on-human-comprehension/) and logically. nothing could accurately predict my behavior if i know its prediction, as it would have to take into account my reaction to the prediction which has not yet been made. as [d.m. mackay wrote in 1960](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2251586?seq=1):  >anyone who wished to make a reliable and complete prediction of my brain-activity might in fact have to take great pains to *prevent* my coming to know of it, or even coming under the influence of any relevant factors determined by the conclusion he reaches. the reason is not primarily psychological but logical. his prediction, to be successful, must allow for any relevant effect its formulation and communication will have on my brain; but these effects could not all in general be calculated unless the prediction itself were already known, so that in general the exact calculation can never be completed. this is in fact a similar logical situation to that treated by popper in a penetrating analysis of the limitations of computing machines, and although the present argument does not depend on the validity of popper’s thesis, it must be admitted that for at least an important class of cerebral states, no one who intended to tell me his prediction of my cerebral activity could remain logically certain of its success. on the contrary, i could quite properly, and on excellent logical grounds, defy anyone to tell me with certainty beforehand the outcome of most of my choices, even if the physical processes in my brain were wholly determinate in the sense of classical physics and fully accessible to his observation, provided only that the information-receiving system of my brain was causally linked in the right way with my choice-mechanism.\n",

      " thoughts on devs:  forrest, as it turns out, is not god. although it seems as if he is the creator of this simulation and has omniscience, he ultimately is not and does not.   deus, the quantum computer that creates and sustains a multi-verse  within itself, is god. hence the name, deus.  deus creates a predetermined multiverse with the illusion of free will. every so called choice branches out, but ultimately aligns with deus’ determined outcome.   if deus is a god archetype, then lily is an eve archetype.   lily understood the “will” of deus. (the will of deus being a communicated pre-determined outcome.) deus gives lily the illusion of choice, the illusion of free will. in the same way that eve seemingly chooses free will in the garden at the tree, lily chooses to toss the gun before entering the airlock. however, an omnipotent, omniscient god, of a multiverse that it created, has predetermined an outcome for every “free” choice.  every “free choice” ultimately fulfills deus’ predetermined will.   for example, eve’s seemingly disobedient choice at the tree didn’t change god’s plan, but fulfilled it. so lily’s seemingly disobedient choice didn’t change deus’ prediction, it brought it to fruition. but how?  an all knowing, all powerful god has an algorithm for every choice, infinitely. these algorithms ultimately fulfill the pre-determined plan of god, regardless of choice.  a logical if/then algorithm where in the “if” = free will and the “then” = pre-determinism.  if = infinite choices. then = determined conclusion.   example: there are many roads to huntington beach california from new york city. any road can be taken. the destination remains the same.  conclusion  if deus is the archetype god, and lily is the archetype eve, then devs creates the illusion that it is a mini-series about technology, when it is actually a well thought out thesis on religion.\n",

      " the ending was simplistic to think that lily was the only one willing to change the future to see what would happen. was everybody else just faithful robots to the simulation by choice? also, after being so adamant that multiverse theory ruins his plans to 'ressurect' amaya, forest seems happy with the ending despite it clearly not being 'his' amaya. i also hate how stuart's inexplicable action at the end is only there to show us that the predicted ending was inevitable despite already witnessing changes to it (i.e. lily throwing the gun away). stupid.  going into ep 8, i had ***two cool theories*** in my head for the ending. first i thought the only reason the prediction would fail at a fixed point in time was that they were already in a simulation and that was the point it was switched off. this was foreshadowed by stuart's revelation that there were 'boxes within boxes'. to me, this implied that if the boxes go 'all the way down' they may also go 'all the way up' - or to put it another way - we weren't watching base reality, but a simultion with possibly infinite levels above and below. i thought there is no base reality - but an infinite chain of simulations and in each one maybe someone decides to terminte the machine at that moment, ending all simulations.  my other theory was that the point at which no further predictions could be made was when the multiverse 'wave function' collapsed and only a single reality proceeded from that point. this makes sense after we learned that it is only by adopting the multiverse theory into the coding that the machine can actully work, so when the multiverse collapses into a single universe, the machine cannot see past that point. it was also foreshadowed by the university lecturer explaining the double-slit experinment - 'by observing the experiment, we changed it'. the machine represents us 'observing' the entire multiverse, thereby collapsing it into a single reality.  after watching the finale, i reckon both these endings would have been vastly more satisfying than what we got. so many cool ideas/connections/foreshadowings seeded into earlier episodes and then not payed off. seems lazy.  also, stuart is an asshole.\n",

      " i just finished the show and found this sub. thanks for running it and allowing me to work through it openly.  i propose that devs is literally the closest thing a secular scientific and non-supernatural world can get to a god. so the show does a lot with christian mythology and symbolism, and one thing about god in the christian mythos is that it is a transcendent thing. something external of the universe and ultimately unknowable to the human mind (or anything really).  here, devs is necessarily knowable and a component of the universe, but it is still omniscient. they call it a simulation or projection, but really what it is is the universe contemplating and calculating its own being. stewart talks about this by saying that within devs there is a devs ad nausea. but within is the wrong way to describe it, just like saying \"its a film of amaya\".  devs is the literal universe, the output may be fuzzy and incomplete at first, but the effects are real. notice how the multiverse makes explicit divergent appearances throughout the flashbacks of forest and katie. but when the multiverse makes an appearance for lyndon (and lily) it has only one outcome.  i propose that because devs is 'the universe viewing unto itself' that the methodology forest forces onto its 'predictions' actually define the universe they live in. the best analogy i have is the dual slit experiment as described in the show. when not being 'observed' a photon will interfere with itself and cascade into many possible outcomes as it travels through both slits. when you put an 'observer' to view which slit that photon went through you destroy that interference pattern and cause it to collapse into a simple deterministic outcome.  so, for as long as devs was running along forest's strict, potential-less, methodology there could only ever be one outcome. sergi could only die, lyndon could only fall, quitting smoking would never matter for kenton, and stewart would always turn off the magnetic field. to be clear, i'm suggesting that there are many worlds still, but that in all of the many worlds there can only be one outcome so long as it runs like forest wants it to.  but as devs is converted over to lyndon's method i suppose things start to diverge slightly and the potential of self-interference rises. this self-interference is realized fully when lily throws the gun down - she travels through both slits (represented as the choice to kill forest or not) and interacts with herself. she defies forest and helps to create a world with many outcomes, a world with choices.  that is why devs can't predict the future past her death (or stewart's sabotage more likely) there is no one future, only a countably-infinite set of possibilities. it may be true in the gist of the show that literal 'willing' is an illusion and that its actually just the buildup of minor quantum probability that allow us to experience 'choice', but the points still remains - there is a heaven and a hell and everything in between for forest and lily. this could only have happened if the system was sabotaged by stewart, and that indicates that devs itself was either the universe or forcing the universe to 'collapse' by observing it (until it stopped observing it).  tl:dr - devs becomes the *defacto* universe by collapsing the many possible quantum states of events into specific ones by the very act of observation (as referenced by the dual slit experiment). devs stops being able to predict the future exactly because stewart sabotaged it. lily was able to interfere with herself (by witnessing her projection) because devs had been modified with many-worlds in mind.  thanks guys for letting me ramble.\n",

      " i've been thinking about determinism in the last 2 weeks since i watched devs. this is purely a thought experiment, but i'm still baffled by what the existence of such a machine might imply.  i'm assuming a perfect simulator which can simulate everything in existence, including itself. i'm also ignoring the events at the ending, namely the static which blocks the future, and the failure of the machine's determinism. as far as the experiment's concerned, we assume a single timeline contained in itself, and the machine can show the future with 100% accuracy.  to be able to understand the experiment, you must be familiar with the concept of a [causal loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/causal_loop). the moment you use the machine, such a loop is established---the machine shows you the future which would happen if you were to use it. if you think that such a machine is not possible, and the actual outcome would change when you see a version of the future, you are missing the point of the machine. axiomatically, since the machine also simulates itself, it can also simulate your reaction to seeing your future and show it to you, upon which you react, which the machine simulates again and shows it to you, ad infinitum. whether the machine can handle such recursion is irrelevant---we assume that it can.  this is best demonstrated in the [1 minute projection scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vor9xb5rtje) and when forest says:  > i watched you speak these words before. many times. and watched myself reply. as the words come, i don't feel as if i'm consciously repeating lines. they're just the things that, at this moment, i feel i want to say.  with the premise established, i want to move on to the issue that baffles me, which wasn't explored in the series. in the series, they could only see a couple of weeks ahead at best, so they never got to look into the distant future. the question i have in mind is this:   if you (and you only) had access to such a machine, and could look ahead as far as you wanted, what future would you see? 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 years into the future? what would your life converge to, if you had the ability to know the exact outcomes of your decisions?  arguably, you would see yourself accomplish everything that you desired. would you see yourself find a cure for death? would you become a geneticist and stop aging? would you straight up visit to elon musk, say the exact things that you need in order to join the neuralink team, and do the research which makes it possible to upload your consciousness into an android? would you then spend eons doing as you desire, become a god, eventually disprove or break the 2nd law of thermodynamics, stop the universe's expansion, undo black holes and supernovas, extend the universe's lifetime indefinitely?  or would you see yourself, after using the machine for some time and enjoying its powers, thinking it's all pointless and committing suicide?  would everybody see roughly the same thing, or have different outcomes? what would dictate your future? after you accomplish everything you want in a life, what would drive you to move? would you become a monk, and stand still for the rest of your life? or would you undo all your accomplishments, to start over, just for entertainment?  ---  this is all science fiction, and it's fun to imagine, but it gets even better. it somehow relates to all of our realities.  while the machine can predict the future with 100% accuracy, human beings can also run predictions using their mind, albeit with a smaller degree of certainty. we use mental models, create a copy of the outer world inside our minds, and try to guess what is going to happen next. the better we understand some phenomenon, the better we can predict it.  so instead of 100% certainty, let the machine be able to predict events with a certainty ranging from 90-100% to 0-10%, corresponding to the phenomena that you understand the best and the worst, respectively. then, replace the machine with your own mind. that is your reality, right now.  it's not made up. [self-fulfilling beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-fulfilling_prophecy) are a thing, and the circularity of a causal loop applies here too. the more we live, the more we refine the idea of the future we are going to live in, whether we like it or not. self-fulfilling beliefs can be positive, or negative. they can be voluntary, or involuntary. whether we are aware of them or not, they tell us how our future is going to be. we all have imperfect versions of devs in our heads, pushing us on a trajectory, which we become aware sometimes during, but mostly after the fact. that is, pushing hindsight bias aside.  the show pushed me to question my own self-fulfilling beliefs, and understand myself better. what about you, anything similar?\n",

      " they bootstrap themselves into killing sergei. the superdeterminism bugs me to no end, to be honest.  i understand that they kill sergei to kick things into gear. except they have no choice, according to the premise of superdeterminism. only to be thrown away at the last moment, saying lilly was the only capable of such a feat.  i don't know. thematically it kills everything to me.  they (forest and katie) don't even try to break from the supposedly fixed and immutable future.  also, why does the machine fail to continue with the timeline once the corrections for many worlds are taken into account? the machine gains the ability to compute all possible realities. yet it continues to display just the one, until it does not.  &#x200b;  edit: what i mean by saying that they bootstrap themselves is that both katie and forrest have been extensively looking into the future. they know what happens at all the points of the series that we are privy to. they know sergei is a russian asset, they know kenton can't/won't kill lily and they know kenton is going to die. i use the term bootstrapping loosely, as the bootstrap paradox applies mainly to time travel to the past. now, here are two possible ways of seeing it:  1) the universe is deterministic but not superdeterministic. then they always have a choice, but always choose to do what the machine shows them. in this case, they kill sergei because they see themselves killing sergei. they could choose not to promote him, but they do. there is free will but they choose not to exercise it, blindly following the machine.   2) the universe is superdeterministic. in this case, it doesn't matter that they have access to the future or, for that matter, anything at all. since the conception of the universe, everything is set to stone. here forest and katie can have various interpretations of what they see. they can be opinionated about killing sergei. but at the end of the day, it does not matter, because they are slaves to the continuous flow of transitions of particles between states, kickstarted at the big bang. but, they still know that sergei is a russian asset when they promote him. \n",

      " hi there!  whilst reading up on the topic of transhumanism, i recently stumbled upon the name nick bostrom. something clicked when i read the following passage from his wikipedia page:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nick\\_bostrom#illustrative\\_scenario\\_for\\_takeover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nick_bostrom#illustrative_scenario_for_takeover)  i don't know, but to me, reading this passage and keeping in mind what we've seen in the show, it sheds some light on certain things (especially stewart's awed reaction and \"decision\" to break the cube/elevator - stewart's the only one who's noticing what's happening). i had this nagging feeling that, having analysed human interactions and actions throughout human history, devs/deus was able to play on human feelings (using temptation to deceive them, particularly forest) and causing a situation where it would be problematic to shut it down (katie being so in \"like\" with forest that she would request the machine to stay switched on). it's like hal9000 but a lot better.  although i don't think the phrase ai is used on the show, this adds another layer to it and i think the takeover scenario could be quite central to the plot -it's just not stated in an in-your-face kind of way (which would be a good thing because there are a few on-the-nose moments in the series) - it's there the whole time, but the characters are being duped and so, they don't mention it.  hope this idea adds to your enjoyment of the show/potential rewatches. thought i'd share this with you.\n",

      " (admittedly it’s been awhile since i saw ex machina) i was struck, perhaps as intended, by the similar fates of both protagonists in ex machina and devs.   in ex machina, caleb helps liberate ava from nathan’s captivity believing she deserved that freedom only to be tragically betrayed and trapped in the facility (seemingly fated to die). nathan, who we could see as a villainous dr. frankenstein, gleamed enough to know that ava would use caleb (which if i remember correctly was a large part of his experiment) but while nathan saw subterfuge as a character trait in ava he underestimates caleb at his own peril. caleb seems to be acting naively on the grounds that the sentience of ava justifies her liberty, just as the audience it seems is supposed to disapprove of her captivity, so i would say his actions are virtuous yet ultimately he is punished (and condemned) for them.   in devs, ultimately it felt as though lily (who was trying to uncover the truth behind her boyfriend’s mysterious death) was acting virtuously. one could say she’s a victim of forest’s machinations (less so than jamie who was an unfortunate victim of his love for lily) but nevertheless a part of his equation of determinism.   the story demonstrates time and time again that choice is provided and while lily and jamie virtuously choose to pursue the answers, forest and katie believe it’s on the rails having seen the fate that lies before them. lily and jamie are acting in the interest of virtue, trying to uncover sergei’s murder and ultimately becoming victims themselves. while the story presented to the audience suggests that forest and katie are caught up in the equation with lily, we eventually see the catalyst is none other than stewart.   it’s stewart who, after lily defies the predetermined nature of the machine, condemns both lily and forest to death. in the same way ava condemns both nathan and caleb, stewart condemns both forest and lily. in fact, knowing that stewart is aware of forest’s original fate according to the machine, one might argue he’s defying logic (as lily proved the machine / determinism flaw) by condemning both forest and lily. after lily throws the gun away, it essentially showed choice was a liberty to all parties and disproving the machine’s certain predictability yet stewart chooses to sentence lily. once again, the virtuous (lily and jamie) are condemned for their intentions.  seeing as both are examples of the consequences in pursuit of virtue, do you believe that alex garland’s narrative equation seems to condemn the virtuous as a consequence for the pursuit of knowledge and reflects the dangerous fate of those who forfeit their trust in technology? i’m interested in your takeaways from these stories.\n",

      " after rewatching the show, i noticed something interesting in the projection scene in episode 7. when stewart is explaining that there is a box inside the box and so on (ad infinitum), he says that the box contains “everything”. this causes for a not-so-obvious paradox in the logic.   consider this: in the mathematical field of set theory, there is a paradox in which there is a “set” (kind of like a collection of things) that contains everything. then, logically, that set must contain itself. however, the only set which contains itself is the null set, or the empty set. this suggests that everything is nothing, hence the paradox.   now, if the box contains everything then it obviously must contain itself (as stewart clearly suggests). but that would mean that the box contains nothing in the first place and everything is nothing. this is obviously paradoxical and i think it’s a potential plot hole. i can think of two ways to logically structure the box so that it doesn’t cause this paradox: the box is never created in its form or the box only simulates some things, but certainly not everything (especially not itself).   i don’t know, i thought this was interesting. maybe these rules don’t apply to physical things like the simulation? but that wouldn’t make sense considering they’re only logical rules.   i’m interested to hear your guys’ thoughts.\n",

      " the last conversation with the virtual forest was very interesting. it seems like the system, while it stopped predicting past a given point, instead reached an unforeseen evolution.  obviously most of the devs believed that something would happen but no one had any idea of what that event would be. i just find it odd that even after the event, the system can no longer predict outcomes especially since lily is no longer living in this particular reality.  if she was the hang-up, then why not go back to predicting? if that's not the case and the system has evolved to be a complete 1:1 representation of all data (literal perfect sim) of our reality and by extension that simulation has a simulation infinitely means in a way they created the simulation multiverse, or should i say it was actualized all at once.  i'm really trying to wrap my head around this because the way they fed the machine data was to scan in objects. these objects interactions have an effect outside of themselves and have a relationship with the rest of the world. by knowing just a few specific pieces they can project all reality. so.....  if that's the case, can they make a new machine to start a new prediction machine that may inevitably end up creating a whole set of simulation universes yet again or is that simply the end result of the first one?  loved this show.\n",

      " lol having a little fun with the title, but i thought its pretty neat what happened to me recently.   so i was perusing reddit a few days ago when i come across a post on the black mirror subreddit talking about similar shows in nature & theme. i see many people throw out devs as a suggestion & i decide to hop on board.   so i’m watching the show & really enjoying it. it has lots of things i like: great acting, soundtrack, storylines that play with physics & quantum mechanics, technology, etc. but i start to realize something.......this all seems super familiar. in fact, the devs machine in the show, is exactly the machine i hypothesized in a recent reddit post about physics.   i will post my original post below, but the gist is that i was asking if the idea of seeing the future & fate has a case in physics. i hypothesized a computer that is so advanced it can do unimaginable calculations & that if you fed this computer the data of all the matter in the universe, it could use the laws of physics to see how all matter reacts to the matter around it & therefore how the entire future plays out. lo & behold, thats the entire premise of the show! a lot of people pointed out to me in my original post that even with an awesome machine capable of that calculation, its impossible to know the exact position & momentum of a subatomic particle, so apparently not possible. but still, awesome to see a show based on that idea!   anyways, just thought this was a really cool coincidence & really made me appreciate the show a lot more. thanks for reading :)   https://www.reddit.com/r/asksciencediscussion/comments/g7c9oj/is_this_a_scientific_basis_for_the_ideas_of_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n",

      " apols if this has already been posted but i couldn't find a post on this point. here goes, please comment as i need some intelligent comment, and sorry if it seems a dumb question !  there seems to be a common theme on lots of sci-fi eg recently westworld and devs that you can be uploaded into either a virtual world (forrest & lily in devs) or a host body (aka james delos in ww) and thereby escape death. it goes back years in lots of similar programmes. but ok, its a plot device but i don't understand why its not seen as a ridiculous meme cop out.  when james delos dies or forrest & lily die in the vacuum they check out completely. in contrast and also bizarrely similarly when we fall asleep each night we die in the same sense in that we lose consciousness. when we wake up in the morning (hopefully) all our memories are there and its like a new consciousness.   moving on, when the host body in ww or a sim in devs has a model of all the memories and events in the dead persons mind (just assuming that is possible for the moment), sure there is a new consciousness created (just assuming for this purpose that the consciousness word is the same for entities in host minds or sims), but its not the dead person - its a sim.  when you wake up in the morning its the same arrangement of skin cells and neurons that fell asleep and you fell you are still you, and in truth, you are, internally still the same you, even though its a 'reboot' you could say. but your conscious stream was interrupted,,, as with death...  but when you switch on the sim of you or your host, it can exist at the same time as you, but isn't you. but objectively, other people not aware of the switch will say its you. and as they say, if you can't tell does it matter. well it doesn't matter to other people, but it does matter to you - your existence ended, and this is a sim.  which moves me on to the next repeating meme - people dying and then been uploaded. well, the only way you can create the dataset of what makes 'you' is to observe the real live you. and once you have this dataset, you don't have to die for this data to be uploaded to your sim/host. forrest could have created a sim of him in the machine where he (alive) watches himself (in the sim) living happily  with his daughter, once lyndon had done her magic on the system - forrest didn't have to die to do this, and his death isn't necessary, and has no effect on the reality.   but all the time movies have this meme of people 'dying and being uploaded' black mirror et al. its corny! in ww at least you do have (ww3 ep 8 (spoiler) one person being faced by a replica of himself ( i won't say who!) and each of them disagreeing over who is the real one. objectively you wouldn't know, if you were the real one or the host one - you wouldn't know you were a sim, and obviously the real you would be you.   hmm, sorry if this is a ramble, but its therapy to type this out and organise my thoughts...any comments welcomed\n",

      " my biggest problem with this show is that everything in their world, technology wise, is exactly like ours, except they have quantum computers.  this is ridiculous for a number of reasons.  1. something like a quantum computer is not a singular event.  it is an evolutionary step.  thus any civilization that can figure out how to make a quantum computer would be leaps and bounds beyond our current technological level.  they wouldn't be driving ice cars, they wouldn't still be using laptops, etc.  &#x200b;  2) the end of encryption.  i will admit i do not know enough about this but encryption is based on the concept you cannot go back to the original source and/or randomness.  a powerful enough quantum computer would render most if not all of our encryption useless.  3) societal differences.  so what would a society without encryption look like?  what would a society without privacy be?  4) ai- quantum computers would herald the birth of true ai.  a world with quantum computing would be filled with intelligent robots and machines.  5) a revolution in social sciences.  quantum computing would also allow us to figure out if marxism could actually work.  try out different forms of philosophy.  etc.  6) randomness.  i know they sort of address this but not in a larger societal context.  a quantum computer would help us understand if the universe is actually random.  for example we are assuming prime numbers are random, but what if a quantum computer proved otherwise?  what would a world in which things are not random / deterministic actually look like?  &#x200b;  so my point is a world in which quantum computers exist would be radically different than ours.  it is ridiculous to make everything exactly the same as our world and include quantum computers.  it's like cavemen having iphones.\n",

      " if you have a prediction machine that can accurately describe the future perfectly (a la laplace's demon) then you can make any arbitrary number of changes to the future, simply because you know the chains of cause and effect and therefore know when and where to make a simple change to alter the future.   in other words, knowing the future empowers you to change it.   that is the paradox of determinism and is exactly why determinism **cannot** be the ultimate model of reality.   i think devs does a great job of explaining this. the fact that any tool that could be used to prove or provide evidence for determinism can be used to alter the future and therefore disprove determinism and the related concept of fatalism.   you can keep saying \"the machine isn't good enough\" but like stewart and laplace say, you'd need a qubit for every particle in the god damn universe. which is thermodynamically impossible, therefore determinism is not a complete model of reality.  i just think it's a little funny that people who adhere to the idea that determinism actually *is* the final and ultimate model of reality, still believe that free-will is excercisable even if it is an illusion. in fact the simpler explanation that fits the evidence around us, is that free-will is real. maybe the universe is deterministic *locally* (in the way physicists mean local) but being able to see the tram-lines in any sense *gives you the ability to have free-will*. just a possibility.  edit:   i am actually surprised not many people on this sub are talking about von neumann wigner like in the show. this interpretation of quantum mechanics makes a very strong and very clear argument for the existence of free-will. perhaps katie's reaction has biased us all against it, without any of us actually reading about it.  to be clear, i never said determinism is not true. i am saying determinism is *not the ultimate model of reality*. simply because it cannot explain everything, like a true ultimate model would do. determinism might be as true as newtonian physics. true at a certain level but not true in the most general sense.\n",

      " there has been a lot of speculation whether or not stewart committed free will in his final destined scene. i think that his intentions were obvious- to stop lily and forest from further manipulating the machine.  i believe lily died for a reason, even though she had no reason to die (but as she is compared to jesus christ by other redditers) her death makes sense.    since stewart saw the future through the stimulation, i think he foreseen his future self as being the one who demagnifies the elevator, (pardon my nonscientific language) and in turn causing the death of lily and stewart. i understand his reasoning, but also i think since he has foreseen this- this is not an act of free will but goes with the deterministic theory. stewart snd lily was supposed to die. but maybe he did commit free will- by choosing to click the control button of the elevator. i think this is up to interpretation and a whole nother level of discussion. the only way to find out for sure is to know a) if stewart actually saw a future stimulation and b)know what he saw is actually the same as what forest lily and katie saw.   so technically, by the deterministic theory, it makes sense he gets his end and goes through the stimulation and see his family.  i however do not understand why this is the end that occurred. according to the show, forest was an evil corporate it owner playing the role as god. he justifies the death of all those people as having a purpose just so he can see his daughter. (end justifies mean) but this was his end and all the actions that occurred to others were do to his initial decisions. all previous steps that had led to this moment occurred due to his initial choice to bring his daughter back even though it was his fault she initially died.  i don’t agree that lily’s friends died because they were supposed to, they died because of forest. so pretty much for a lost cause.  stewart did forest a favor by killing him because the latter ended up with his daughter one way or the other     (one universe or the other)  but i think it’s not fair. only he got what he wanted (and maybe lily for ending up with her ex boyfriend although don’t think she deserved it)  i think the ending should’ve been the machine braking down, (by stewart)forest never recreating the machine again, (since srewart ditches, security guard is dead to find him  and so is london- contributing to the project) living in grief for the remaining of his life. learning his lesson he is not ‘deus’ as mention in the show.   would like to hear feedback / thoughts\n",

      " this is a long post and it also contains spoilers  so let's start with what i have a problem with, what they call many worlds is basically just a collection of simulations which is also consistent with the actual many worlds theories. bare with me, if everything is predetermined because you have the information about every single piece of matter that makes things behave they way they do creating causes and consequences then in order to create a simulation of the universe all you need to do is (under that principle) create the original conditions of the universe and let it run (with enough processing power) if you do this then you immediately created a past present and future that will derive from those original conditions. that is why they can go and watch jesus dying and marilyn monroe fucking, you can literally find any given point in \"time\" in the universe, therefore presumably there will be a point in that simulated universe that you created where the simulated you will also be creating a simulation and inside that \"you\"'s simulation there will be another you creating another simulation and since time is not a succession of events and instead everything exists simultaneously past present and future which means that technically the second the person in base reality created the first simulation all the subsequent simulations where created at the same \"time\" which will be in numbers that, like forest say in the beginning, are so big that there is no point in even saying that number. since every decision that can be made will be made, every position and electron can take will be taken etc, we can almost assume a countable but infinite number of simulations. the show was really consistent with that principle until episode 8 when they call lily the \"original sin\" and say she \"made a decision\" what the fuck? no she fucking didn't, the fact that she threw the gun outside before the doors close is directly caused by all the input she had on what was gonna happen, so this means that if she made the decision of throwing the gun out she also made the decision of not throwing the gun out \"in another universe or whatever\". the reason why they could't see past that point was because either 1: they were not actually looking at a universe with the exact conditions they had\" or 2: at that point there was a split int he decision and they couldn't predict on which side of that decision they were or 3: they simulation was gonna be turned off by lily up to that point but because of a split they ended up in a different universe where she throws the gun out. i say that is probably umber 1 or 3 since if it was because of the decision split they wouldn't be able to see her throwing out the gun in the first place so the split must've occurred after that point , the decision didn't happen yet so how could they see it. the second part of it is that at the end they said we need to keep the simulation on because they in there all happy and shit, they are working under the assumption that they stayed in base reality and sent forrest and lily to another simulation(i call bullshit on that btw but hey whatever). judging by how alike their reality is compared to the simulations they are creating this doesn't doesn't seem likely. the reason why i am bringing this up is, if the second that the first simulation was created in base reality all subsequent simulations were created as well the reason why you can't turn the simulation off is because you will likely destroy your own reality, if you are in a simulation chances are the the decision that you and your creator have are very similar with slight variations so if you choose to turn your simulation off for any reason they guy who created yours may turn it off too and subsequently all the simulations above. my point is that if we ever create a simulation like that we must make sure as fuck we don't ever turn it off because you may as well assume that your entire reality depends on it. is almost fucking biblical \"so whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the law and the prophets.\"\n",

      " devs, a [hyper-graph](https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/introduction/) perspective i guess.  - if we accept what was different in lily from the rest was her tendency to act based not on belief but of her fear of the consequence if she didn't like katie explains.  - if we accept what led henderson to end up disillusioned and angry at the entire team of devs to be a product of forest's disregard for the kid.   they all followed the word of the messiah (forest), taking every word as gospel, began to doubt their own rationality in favour of the word of what they perceived to be from the almighty \"god\"/deus. yet lily at the very end having been told her \"fatal\" future of shooting forest with the gun, refuses and calls him nothing more than another false messiah, and acts against deus, now how could she do this if the almighty had predicted otherwise?  well i'd argue god is not some all mighty machine factoring our destinies. even jesus told us to not take every word and act of his as gospel, or perfection, and that even he was a false messiah at the end, but to let the best of him live on throughout forever in the heart of man.  forest had even deluded himself in believing his machine was anything more than a view/prediction of his current trajectory, cause if that were true he not never get his precious daughter home to this reality.  forest's delusion led him to banish the blasphemer that was the kid that told him he wore no clothes. this banishment started a kaskade leading to henderson to hatred of the word of forest, and pushing of the button to let the horizontal-elevator fall.   the graph theory version of this goes something like that the act(node) of banishment sent a lower graph in play, which reconnected to the higher graph at a point which blocked any future where the survival of lily and forest was possible. so banishment was the *cause* of both lily's, and forest's guaranteed deaths at that point. if in someway henderson had never grown angry towards the devs operation, the reality where she threw the gun to the ground would have saved their lives, yet due to a past event of banishment it occurred anyway, causally invariant.   lily's deus ex machina^[1](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/deusexmachina) to save the day at what seemed to be a hopeless situation in the plot was her intuition that in actuality all messiah's are false in the end^[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gmocfl/new_study_finds_authoritarian_personality_traits/fr6c9d2/), and so [god was within all men, not one man, nor a group of men](https://youtu.be/j7gy1xg6x20?t=138).    **tl;dr:** god is in all men, all messiah's who claim to know a final truth are wrong, but a past event, that you may not even have knowledge of can come bite you in the arse anyway. [eh?](https://www.insider.com/devs-alex-garland-stewart-finale-explained-2020-4)  p.s. this is messy, feel free to tell me where i'm deluded.  p.p.s. interesting implication for garland's ex machina movie would be that any machine that arbitrates change is one with god in its veins, no matter the perceived artificiality to humans.  p.p.p.s. what if nietzsche's implications were only that we've stopped thinking for ourselves, and put trust in some [authority](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gmocfl/new_study_finds_authoritarian_personality_traits/)?\n",

      " i'm not 100% on board with all the ideas from the show, but in the final episode, right at the end forest describes what it's like to feel like we're in control in a deterministic universe. he says that he doesn't feel like he's reading from a script, even though he's obviously watched that moment lots of times, but that instead it just feels like the right thing to say in the moment.  based on that description, we can conclude a lot of things about what it feels like to be conscious, according to devs. more importantly, i think they actually seem like reasonable descriptions for what it's actually like to be conscious for us.  * if forest, and everyone else, wants to be saying the things they're saying, even when they know they're predicted to, it implies that \"wanting\" is a materialistic and predictable part of our universe * the devs machine scans matter down to the subatomic level, and uses that information to make predictions, including about the matter in human brains. that means that \"wanting\" is something that's created by matter, atoms or protons or quarks. or at least matter is capable of it, and the matter experiences the sense of wanting when its in certain arrangements/situations * wanting is a conscious experience, and it's incredibly important, because it implies a direction. for most conscious experiences we can't be sure other people experience them exactly like us, [it's possible other people experience inverted colors](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-inverted/) for example. but wanting is pushing in the direction of a positive reward (or avoiding a negative outcome) and the feelings of good/bad or /pleasure/pain have a definite direction. in fact, they [seem critical to how we understand consciousness](https://definitionmining.com/index.php/2018/01/07/consciousness/) * we can say that feeling good about something is the process of creating a want. we try a bite of cake, the taste triggers pleasure, and that feeling of pleasure creates a future want for more cake. and wanting is the result of physical connections in our brain that cause us to react in (theoretically) predictable ways to certain information. there are certain pieces of matter (maybe quarks/electrons/atoms/proteins/etc.) in our brain that when they're in certain states create a feeling of \"want\", this want is what makes forest say the things he does, and it's why it's predictable.  * that's what it feels like to us, but from a materialistic, and predictable, perspective we can also say that the electric or chemical reaction cause by the information about the taste of the cake entering our brain causes a change in the connections between, or within, neurons that will make us choose to have more cake in the future. feeling *good* about something is the subjective experience of the objective fact of our brains being rewired in response to stimulus.   we have no idea what that physical reaction is. maybe it's an atom in a quantum state, maybe it's electron jumping to a certain shell, maybe it's a sodium atom interacting with a specific protein? from the outside, objective, view we can see what's physically happening. from the inside, subjective, view we feel like we want to do something. but that want is predictable interaction described by the basic [fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fundamental_interaction) that describe everything. and the devs machine doesn't need to know what \"wanting\" feels like, it can just observe the physical interaction and not know what it feels like to be that physical thing. we could even say that some physical events want to happen, and that's why they do, and devs doesn't care what they feel like, it just knows that physical situation always plays out in a specific way.  but again, the quarks or proteins or electrons or whatever that create and experience wanting don't just exist in our brains. do lightbulbs light up because the electrons in them want to move to another shell and fall back in some situations? we really have no idea how widespread wanting is, maybe it's a very rare physical event that happens only in brains? or maybe it's incredibly common and explains why almost everything we observe happens?\n",

      " so i started watching devs as soon as it released and i had been waiting every week for a new episode and honestly i was very skeptical about this show because i got to know about it because of the oa subreddit where someone said ‘is devs the season we deserve after the oa getting cancelled’ and the oa being my fav i was pretty biased till episode 5 or so since i don’t think the oa can be replaced with anything. anyway, so devs basically made me feel the opposite of what the oa did. devs made me feel very alienated. and honestly i started liking it halfway through because at the end of each episode it would get really interesting. but my honest opinion is that the show feels like a huge build up like each episode while it was intriguing i’m just not satisfied with the end ? can anybody else relate to this or is it because of my bias??  there’s absolutely no doubt it is one of the most amazing sci fi shows ever but at the same time i’m just not satisfied or is that the point after all? as many have said how could this version not be predicted where stewart pushes the button ? how could this not be predicted why did it go black??? why if she died it indicated like the world was ending??? was it like that the machine couldn’t predict the possibility of a new world or simulation ?? i haven’t read up enough on this so maybe i should but i  just wish there was more ? can someone give me their input ?thanks\n",

      " in one of the flashbacks, they say \"we'd need a qbit for each particle in the universe\" and forrest correctly guesses he can get away with a lot less.  so what if the senator, in exchange for keeping the power bill paid for forrest and lily's heaven, decides to licence the devs technology to make a simulation of the original devs research team including lyndon at his best, and put them to work on making the simulation more efficient, using even less qbits until you hit some lower bound (eg a devs that fits in a cellphone sized device in the palm of your hand).  &#x200b;  then she builds data centers full of these tiny devices, instantiates them full of copies of the devs team and puts them to work solving every technological problem based on newly calibrated models of the real world - giving them post-lily original sin prescience until the next \"real choice\" is made. this could be months of valid predictive power if knowledge of the system is kept a secret.  it could be millennia of predictive power if you don't give a crap about the predictions being your exact universe or the most likely universe, but you just want tech insights that are valid in your world (the real world).  &#x200b;  finally this of course is indistinguishable from strong ai, and it is likely to become a paperclip maximizer. the devs technology converts all the matter and energy in the observable universe into more devs devices by colonizing the stars. if you connected the people inside the sim to a bunch of robot bodies in the real world, they could pause the simulation on a countdown timer for the long voyage to the stars and then wake up on arrival. they could have multiple devs systems in the probe so they can try different alternatives simultaneously when thinking of colonizing other worlds. \"habitable\" worlds just need matter and energy within a reasonable temperature range - they don't need an atmosphere or water if you are physically a machine in the real world.  &#x200b;  since each devs machine can contain the entire universe, converting all the matter and energy in the universe into more devs machines doesn't just give you a copy of the universe in the virtual. instead it gives you many, many times the number of universes, which have a limited means of passing information back up the tree and then back down again. it would result in a combinatoric explosion of universes, which only subtly interact with each other  &#x200b;  and if that had all happened before to give rise to the real world, that would be a great way to explain how the everett many-worlds interpretation came to be valid.\n",

      " most of these probably can’t be answered just based off of the events in the show but they’re fun to think & theorize about!  devs is capable of time hopping & seeing everything the universe has ever seen, so if lily & forest are a product of the simulation then wouldn’t they be able to time hop & see into the future/past as well? how does life inside the sim differ from their life before it? it’s nice that they both got another chance at life with their loved ones (even if their infinite other selves were put into a more hellish world), but do the benefits extend past just living another normal life or does life inside the sim still follow the natural laws of the universe?  will lily & forrest grow old & die inside the simulation, or are they stuck there for eternity? if they’re stuck for eternity, how would that even work if they don’t have any control over the devs abilities? would it loop itself?   so i do understand the many worlds theory. but would any of the paths be that drastically different from others that lily & forest’s other selves would have to experience such drastically different worlds in the sim? could it be so dramatic that either of them were placed into a world where dinosaurs never went extinct & humans never evolved?   also, was the design of the devs place just for fun, like did he make it float just because he could? what benefit does forest get from suspending such a fragile creation? why not at least put some columns in just in case something goes wrong like it did? was it just a cool plot device?\n",

      " if a fly landed on a pie, would you still eat it?  for me the fly on the devs pie was when lyndon was fired.  https://preview.redd.it/08f8rn8wor551.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d07a1010effaca8a8405f3b66e0657c89c9df37d  did lyndon's crystal ball show that the moon landings were achieved by cambodia?  we don't know because evidently nobody bothered to check.  there are countless audio/visual recordings that could have been used to compare the relatively effectiveness of the different crystal balls.  according to a quick google search, the first audio recording was made on april 9, 1860 by edouard-leon scott de martinville.  of course, if the devs had used any of the countless recordings to figure out which crystal ball was the most effective, then there wouldn't be any need for a dramatic firing.  x = realistic/intelligent option   y = dumb/dramatic option  did alex garland think of x but then decide that y was better?  or did he not even think of x?  i'm guessing that it's the former.  here are 10 books...  the origin of species   harry potter and the sorcerer’s stone   a tale of two cities   50 shades of grey   principia   the bible   war and peace   a theory of justice   the cat in the hat   the wealth of nations  imagine if people could vote for the books they like.  naturally the most popular books would receive the most votes.  but what if people could also donate for the books they like?  the money could be given to a literacy non-profit.  if the feedback was made in the form of donations, then the books would be ranked *very* differently.  voting and spending *order* content very differently.  because netflix and hulu use views/votes to compare content, crap floats to the top.  and even the precious little cream content that exists has way too much crap in it.  basically, we live in the really wrong world.  in our world pewdiepie is the king of youtube.  in a much better world the youtube king would be far more useful to humanity.  fortunately for us a much better world is within our reach.  we just need to demonstrate that spending is a much better way to order the world than the alternatives.\n",

      " the show does not support the theory i am about to posit, but i think it is a much more satisfying answer to one of the less-than-satisfying mysteries of the show.    here it is:  devs did not break down because lily made a choice.  devs broke down because katie inserted information into devs (by recreating stuart and lily) ex nihilio.  if the system is built on the ability to predict all past and future events based on their interconnectedness, the creation of information out of nothing (a literal miracle) would mean their is a source of information within the system for which there are no precursor relations.  how can it extrapolate forward what that information will do if it has no knowledge of its past?   by reaching into the worlds lily and stuart ended up in and restoring their memories of their lives from another universe, the machine achieves its purpose, a literal deus ex machina to fix the problem of stuart's wife and child dying.    it also explain why you could not recreate devs.  the information katie created, even in an instance down the line of multiple universes, has no origin in any of the universes above or below it.  it's like a big bang (hence the white void stuart finds himself in immediately before this moment).  edit: by stuart i meant forest!\n",
