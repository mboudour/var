       " u'TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM>\\n  General Motors Corp staged an explosive\\n  rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced\\n  yesterday, but analysts said GM\\'s future remains clouded by\\n  stiff competition and erosion of market share.\\n      GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts\\n  agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they \\n  differed sharply over the carmaker\\'s long term prospects.\\n      \"I\\'m very positive on GM,\" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder\\n  Peabody and Co. \"They\\'re clearly committed to enhancing\\n  shareholder value.\"\\n      However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the\\n  buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to\\n  recapture lost market share.\\n      After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy\\n  back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The\\n  announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,\\n  with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.\\n      The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the\\n  stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at\\n  least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a\\n  good performance expected from new car models.\\n      But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the\\n  repurchase program is not a positive.\\n      \"The buyback doesn\\'t really change the earnings outlook and\\n  puts more stress on the balance sheet,\" he said, since GM will\\n  have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock\\n  should settle back down to around 76, he added.\\n      Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and\\n  5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.\\n  Healy\\'s numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,\\n  which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four\\n  dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.\\n      Like other analysts, Healy sees GM\\'s share of the domestic\\n  car and truck market falling in 1987. \"On balance, GM cars are\\n  not selling as well as their competitors,\" he said.\\n      In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the\\n  year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and\\n  Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February\\n  sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects\\n  improvement in coming months.\\n      Overall, GM\\'s share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall\\n  to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,\\n  analysts said. The numbers include imports.\\n      Kidder Peabody\\'s Kirnan said cost reductions and product\\n  improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the\\n  fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.\\n      \"GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it\\'s rolling up\\n  its sleeves and getting serious. I think there\\'s a major\\n  earnings surprise in the winds,\" he said.\\n      Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in\\n  part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning\\n  5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. \"The company is more\\n  concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation\\n  with respect to Ford and Chrysler,\" he said.\\n      Another positive for the stock is GM\\'s dividend, currently\\n  five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than\\n  its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash\\n  dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.\\n      But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc\\n  said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM\\'s new products, if\\n  successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its\\n  market share.\\n      \"I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will\\n  only curtail losses in market share,\" which will fall to around\\n  35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.\\n      Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle\\n  of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he\\n  said results will not improve until 1988.\\n      \"I\\'m not looking for improvement this year. This is a\\n  transition year for GM,\" he said.\\n      Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988\\n  at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not\\n  affect 1987 results. \"But the key thing isn\\'t so much what they\\n  earn this year.

But January\\'s\\n  sales were revised down to a 7.4 pct drop, from a previously\\n  reported 5.8 pct decline.\\n      \"The trend is toward continued spending but certainly at a\\n  much more sluggish pace,\" said Don Maude of Midland Montagu\\n  Capital Markets Inc.\\n      Maude averaged out the wide swings in the retail sales data\\n  over past four months to show that the pace of consumer\\n  spending is slowing.\\n      Combining the latest data with a 0.6 pct drop in November\\n  and a 4.6 pct gain in December, the average retail sales gain\\n  over the four months was 0.2 pct, he said, compared to to a 0.4\\n  pct rise for year-over-year sales through February.\\n      \"You can see a pattern developing,\" Maude said. \"I wouldn\\'t\\n  be surprised to see a fall-off in March, especially since sales\\n  probably won\\'t be boosted by auto sales as they were in\\n  February.\"\\n      Despite the weak underlying trend, economists were\\n  impressed by a robust 1.5 pct gain in total sales excluding\\n  autos in February. This compared to a revised 0.4 pct decline\\n  in January, previously reported as a 0.1 pct decline.\\n      \"The increase in non-auto sales was broadbased, with gains\\n  in durable goods as well as non-durables,\" noted Ward McCarthy\\n  of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. \"It was a pretty healthy\\n  report.\"\\n      He noted that building materials rose 1.8 pct in February\\n  after falling 1.7 pct in January.

This followed a 27.7 pct drop\\n  in January, previously reported as a 22.4 pct fall, due largely\\n  to the expiration of the sales tax deduction under new tax laws\\n  January 1, the Commerce Department noted.\\n      Some economists argued that the because the gain in total\\n  sales excluding autos also followed a decline in January, the\\n  strength in the February report is less than impressive.\\n      \"There is strength in the February data, but that\\'s because\\n  they were compared to low sales levels in January,\" said said\\n  Beth Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. \"We don\\'t see it as a\\n  precursor of continued strength.\"\\n      Durable goods sales rose 8.8 pct in February, after falling\\n  17.7 pct in January. February non-durable goods sales gained\\n  1.3 pct, after declining 0.2 pct in January.\\n      Gasoline service station sales rose two pct in February,\\n  following a 1.9 pct gain in January, but economists said higher\\n  oil prices rather than an increased volume of gas sales\\n  probably accounted for these gains.\\n      Reiners also emphasized that the trend in consumer spending\\n  is weakening. Total retail sales on average were 123 billion\\n  dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986, she said. In January, they\\n  fell to a seasonally adjusted 117.52 bilion dlrs, and in\\n  February rose to 122.29 billion dlrs.\\n      \"On average, it looks like they\\'ll total 120 to 121 mln\\n  dlrs in the first quartrer,\" she said. \"We don\\'t look at this\\n  as indication that the economy is barrelling along.\"\\n      \"The number is not really that problematic for those of us\\n  who are constructive on the bond market,\" agreed Elliot Platt\\n  of Donaldsen Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp.\\n      Platt does not foresee potential for tighter monetary\\n  policy on the basis of the latest retail sales report.\\n      \"The Fed is on hold now because the data have been so\\n  confusing,\" he said.\\n      \"Before the 337,000 gain in February non-farm payroll\\n  employment, I would have looked for a discount rate cut in\\n  March,\" he said. \"But now Fed officials will have to wait for\\n  the first quarter real U.S. gross national product data in\\n  April to sort things out.\"\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

IBM was trading up 7/8 at\\n  149-1/2 dlrs.\\n      Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company\\n  itself, have highlighted the external economic factors\\n  hampering IBM\\'s growth.\\n      But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding\\n  the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and\\n  pointed to Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> to support his view.\\n  \"By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,\" he said\\n  of DEC\\'s line of VAX computers.\\n      In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible\\n  mid-range product line. A new computer code-named \"Fort Knox\"\\n  was supposed to tie together a number of IBM\\'s mid-range\\n  systems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.\\n      Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the\\n  IBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should\\n  be unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. \"The major story will be a\\n  rebound in its mid-range business.\"\\n      He said sales of IBM\\'s mid-range computers fell about 13\\n  pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth\\n  in mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.\\n      High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming\\n  to the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5\\n  pct in the midst of IBM\\'s sharply lower 1986 year, growth will\\n  drop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.\\n      By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16\\n  pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin\\n  said. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of\\n  51.3 billion dlrs.\\n      Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings\\n  and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product\\n  introductions in the mid-range area.\\n      In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to\\n  DEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were\\n  catering largely to existing customer bases, rather than\\n  stealing market share from one another.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

This week, many\\n  of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to\\n  agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work.\\n      The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the\\n  International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses\\n  running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting\\n  a shadow over commodity negotiations.\\n      The ITC\\'s failure has restricted negotiators\\' ability to\\n  compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts\\n  with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear\\n  lines drawn between aid and trade.\\n      A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic\\n  elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in\\n  Geneva at the weekend.\\n      Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa\\n  Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with\\n  quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to\\n  be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would\\n  \"distort, not support\" the market.\\n      Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO\\n  for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee\\n  prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can\\n  founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa\\n  futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has\\n  also contributed to the recent slip in prices.\\n      The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the\\n  \"must buy\" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact,\\n  which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but\\n  without rules for the operation of the buffer stock.\\n      Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should\\n  operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement\\n  limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it\\n  cannot operate on futures markets.\\n      A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost\\n  100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or\\n  selling operations, were carried forward from the previous\\n  agreement.\\n      Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on\\n  all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes.\\n      The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on\\n  buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be\\n  over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should\\n  pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working\\n  group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative\\n  matters, and the full council meets on Thursday.\\n      Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds\\n  should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member\\n  countries such as Malaysia.\\n      Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer\\n  stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate\\n  manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas.\\n      The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked\\n  to the one over differentials for different qualities.\\n      European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a\\n  compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can\\n  represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures\\n  market\\'s existing differentials for different qualities.\\n      Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto\\n  the London market.\\n      Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50\\n  stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa.\\n      Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would\\n  operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the\\n  highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower.\\n      The January talks were slowed by a split inside the\\n  European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France\\n  siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session\\n  in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground\\n  and, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions\\n  among the 12 nations.\\n      The source said the EC will be looking for signs of\\n  flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and\\n  will be able to respond if they are there.\\n      One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split\\n  said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and\\n  backs the concept of the pact which is \"meant to support the\\n  market where trade buying is not.\"\\n      In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their\\n  cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers.\\n      Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include\\n  whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced\\n  \"posted price\" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is\\n  buying then accepting offers.\\n      In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that\\n  producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of\\n  cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a\\n  way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

The move complicated a USAir\\n  takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to\\n  accepting the bid.\\n      Today, USAir rejected Icahn\\'s 52 dlr per share offer and\\n  said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its\\n  takeover of Piedmont.

USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread\\n  it would be taken over.\\n      Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt\\n  to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a\\n  suitor who might want both airlines once they merged.\\n     \"The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or\\n  Piedmont and USAir announce a deal,\" speculated one arbitrager.\\n      Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current\\n  price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir\\'s bid will\\n  succeed.\\n      Piedmont\\'s largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk\\n  Southern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the\\n  company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of\\n  Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.\\n      Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of\\n  Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is\\n  destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the\\n  least likely to be bought.\\n      Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in\\n  the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a\\n  three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.\\n      But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn\\'s\\n  offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with\\n  contingencies.\\n      Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two\\n  airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.\\n      \"You can\\'t discount him,\" said one arbitrager.\\n      Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is\\n  serious by following through with his threats or making a new\\n  offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go\\n  directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower\\n  price if USAir rejected his offer.\\n      \"It\\'s clear Icahn wants to sell and he\\'s bluffing,\" said\\n  one arbitrager.\\n      Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by\\n  about six dlrs per share.\\n      Some analysts believe Icahn\\'s proposed three-way airline\\n  combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but\\n  others believe it could be cleared if the companies are\\n  acquired separately.\\n      \"TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to\\n  work,\" said one analyst.\\n      Analysts said such a merger would be costly and\\n  complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn\\n  succeeded in winning concessions from its unions.\\n      In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA\\'s wage\\n  scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,\\n  analysts said.\\n      Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they\\n  said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines\\'\\n  costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a\\n  necessary ingredient for a merger to work.\\n      However, other analysts speculated the managements of\\n  Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new\\n  company.

       " u'EUROPEAN BEET PLANTINGS SEEN LITTLE CHANGED\\n  European sugar beet plantings are\\n  expected to show little change from last year, despite recent\\n  firmness in world prices, analysts and industry sources said.\\n      A Reuter survey of planting intentions showed that while,\\n  so far, European Community (EC) growers plan unchanged to lower\\n  areas, increases are expected in some Eastern European nations.\\n      Trade analysts said their private reports give similar\\n  results and do not differ significantly from the first estimate\\n  of stagnant 1987 European beet plantings made last week by West\\n  German sugar statistician F. O. Licht.\\n      Areas may be slightly lower but analysts and agricultural\\n  experts said the steady rise in yields resulting from improved\\n  seed varieties and better farming techniques could offset this.\\n  In recent years, good autumn weather has given yields a late\\n  boost, making up for lower areas despite some disappointing\\n  starts to growing seasons.\\n      Changes in EC areas reflect the extent to which producers\\n  will grow so-called \"C\" sugar for unsubsidised sale to the world\\n  market. This is what is produced in excess of the basic area\\n  needed to meet the EC \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, which receive full and\\n  partial price support, respectively.\\n      Some analysts said the open row that broke out last week\\n  between producers and the EC commission over its export policy\\n  could have serious implications for future sugar output.\\n      Beet producers have threatened to effectively dump nearly\\n  one mln tonnes of white sugar into EC intervention stocks as\\n  they feel export subsidies have been too low to compensate for\\n  the gap between high EC internal and low world market prices.\\n      However, with the EC budget stretched to breaking point,\\n  this could give treasury ministers extra resolve in resisting\\n  higher guaranteed sugar prices and build a case for a future\\n  cut in the basic \"A\" and \"B\" quotas, they added.\\n      In France, the largest producer of EC quota and non quota\\n  sugar, the sugar market intervention board FIRS said first\\n  planting intentions indicate an area about the same as last\\n  year\\'s 421,000 hectares, nine pct below the previous year.\\n      \"The basic trend is towards stability,\" a FIRS spokesman\\n  said. Unlike world market raw sugar prices in dollars, white\\n  sugar French franc prices are not particularly high and are not\\n  encouraging higher planting levels, he said. Beet sugar output\\n  last year was 3.37 mln tonnes, with an average yield of 8.00\\n  tonnes per ha, the highest in the EC apart from the Netherlands\\n  but below 8.52 the previous year and a five year average 8.11.\\n      In West Germany, recent price rises have not altered plans,\\n  since planting decisions were taken a few months ago, industry\\n  sources said. The farm ministry said a December survey is still\\n  valid and plantings should be cut slightly after being trimmed\\n  by just under four pct in 1986 when yields were above average.\\n      Licht last week estimated West German plantings at a\\n  reduced 385,000 hectares against 399,000 last year.\\n      British Sugar Plc, the monopoly beet processor, has signed\\n  up U.K. Farmers to grow 8.1 mln tonnes of beet. This should\\n  yield about 1.25 mln tonnes of whites. Last year\\'s crop\\n  equalled the second highest ever at 1.32 mln tonnes.\\n      British Sugar has \"A\" and \"B\" quotas totalling 1.144 mln tonnes\\n  of whites and its \"C\" output is due to improved yields from more\\n  consistent disease-resistant seed types.\\n      Recent price rises have not altered Polish plans, Wincenty\\n  Nowicki, a deputy director of Cukropol, the Amalgamated Sugar\\n  Industry Enterprises, said. World prices are still below Polish\\n  production costs and there is no way to convince farmers to\\n  increase the area above the already signed contracted level.\\n      The national plan, set before prices began to rise, put\\n  plantings this year at 460,000 hectares, against 425,000 in\\n  1986, Nowicki said. Last year production was 1.74 mln tonnes.\\n      World prices have less impact in Italy than in France or\\n  Germany as it is traditionally not an exporter but is geared to\\n  the domestic market, an official at the national beet growers\\'\\n  association said. Italian sowings are not yet complete but\\n  surveys suggest a drop from last year\\'s 270,000 ha, especially\\n  in the north where some farmers have switched to soya.\\n      Beet output last season of 15.5 mln tonnes yielded a higher\\n  than expected 1.72 mln tonnes of white sugar.\\n      Dutch plantings are expected to fall to 130,000 ha from a\\n  record 137,600 in 1986 as a new self-imposed quota system comes\\n  into force, a spokesman for Centrale Suiker, the second largest\\n  Dutch sugar processor, said.\\n      The new system aims for an average of around 915,000 tonnes\\n  of white sugar and to cut output of \"C\" sugar. Last year, the\\n  Netherlands produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar\\n  against a combined \"A\" and \"B\" quota of only 872,000 tonnes.\\n      \"The world price of sugar would have to rise much higher\\n  than it has done recently to make planned production of \"C\" sugar\\n  really worthwhile,\" the spokesman said.\\n      Western agricultural experts in Moscow said Soviet planting\\n  intentions are likely to be unchanged. Licht put this year\\'s\\n  Soviet beet area at 3.40 mln ha, against 3.44 mln last year.\\n      Hungary is expanding its beet area to 105,000 ha from some\\n  95,000 in 1986, the official MTI news agency said, but\\n  diplomats said policy is to balance supply with domestic\\n  demand.\\n      The Spanish ministry of agriculture said beet sowings are\\n  estimated unchanged at 180,000 ha this year.\\n      A spokesman for Denmark\\'s largest beet concern, De Danske\\n  Sukkerfabrikker A/S, said its 1987 sugar target was unchanged\\n  from 1986 at 365,000 tonnes from a steady area of 60,000 ha.\\n      In Sweden, where beet is grown just to meet domestic\\n  demand, the planted area is seen little changed at 51,000 ha\\n  against 51,300 last year, according to a spokesman for sugar\\n  company Svenska Sockerfabriks AB.\\n      Last year, Irish yields were the lowest for 10 years due to\\n  late sowings and the state-run Irish Sugar Plc said the 1987\\n  plantings target is the equivalent of 36,400 hectares, down\\n  from 37,600 in 1986.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

The annual growth target for both is\\n  5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target.\\n      \"In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the\\n  Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money\\n  growth,\" said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government\\n  Securities Inc.\\n      Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary\\n  growth in March after February\\'s anemic growth rates.

This number has risen three to four\\n  billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February\\'s\\n  weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2\\n  and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March.\\n      Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return\\n  to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so\\n  continue to present no problem for the Fed.\\n      Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with\\n  its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps\\n  several more months of economic data before deciding whether or\\n  not to ease its grip on reserves.\\n      Given the economy\\'s fragility in many sectors, the analysts\\n  agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose\\n  to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next\\n  changes policy.\\n      \"Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as\\n  low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six\\n  pct,\" said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct\\n  in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week.\\n      The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of\\n  customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on\\n  Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added\\n  reserves directly through two-day System repurchases.\\n      Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate\\n  be largely market-driven.

       " u'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - EMS MARKS EIGHTH BIRTHDAY\\n  The European Monetary System marks its\\n  eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money\\n  markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability\\n  in Europe, economists say. But many economists say the system,\\n  which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow\\n  fluctuation bands, remains in its infancy.\\n      Its new currency, the European Currency Unit (Ecu), has\\n  been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike\\n  seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar.\\n      And on Wednesday, the long term vision of the Ecu as\\n  Europe\\'s common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality\\n  when Belgium minted the world\\'s first Ecu coin.\\n      But economists say members such as West Germany have so far\\n  blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system\\'s\\n  founding fathers, ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and\\n  former French President Valery Giscard d\\'Estaing.\\n      Under this phase, originally due to have started two years\\n  after the EMS was set up, decision-making was to have been\\n  transferred from national governments and central banks to an\\n  autonomous European Monetary Fund.\\n      But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in\\n  economic and monetary matters. \"The basic problem of the EMS is\\n  that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a\\n  situation where certain decisions are taken in common,\" said one\\n  economist who has closely watched the system\\'s development.\\n      The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on\\n  third currencies, accentuating what the economists say is the\\n  system\\'s greatest weakness, its vulnerability to a weak dollar.\\n      Over the past 18 months, as the U.S. Dollar plunged and\\n  investors moved into strong currencies, the resulting sharp\\n  rise of the West German mark severely strained the system.\\n      Another frustration has been Britain\\'s failure to lend the\\n  EMS political support by keeping the pound, still a major world\\n  currency, outside the system.\\n      No change in the British government\\'s attitude is expected\\n  before the country\\'s next general elections, due by mid-1988.\\n      Meanwhile, the system\\'s last realignment, the 11th since it\\n  was set up, prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC\\'s\\n  highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central\\n  Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it.\\n      Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers\\n  hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month.\\n      But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve\\n  more than tinkering with technical details. They are sceptical\\n  about the chances for any fundamental change.\\n      \"Technical measures won\\'t be enough to protect the EMS\\n  against external factors such as dollar weakness. For that we\\n  must take the step forward to the institutional level,\" said Leo\\n  de Corel of Kredietbank\\'s economic research department.\\n      Economists say the system\\'s fortunes now will depend\\n  largely on the success of an agreement last month among major\\n  industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates.

But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based\\n  banks are boosting their treasury operations in London.\\n      As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade\\n  finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain\\n  ran down their currency operations.

But in the\\n  end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.\"\\n      One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.\\n      The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated\\n  since the start of the GCC.

       " u'NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN\\n  The highly visible drama involving the\\n  yen\\'s sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact\\n  that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major\\n  European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate\\n  distortions, Japanese and European research officials said.\\n      The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements\\n  by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the\\n  currency movements of the past two years are also creating a\\n  fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new\\n  trade tensions and imbalances.\\n      Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are\\n  already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-\\n  European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.\\n      In many ways, not least in terms of rare international\\n  cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between\\n  the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down\\n  the value of the dollar was a historic one.\\n      But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major\\n  currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which\\n  the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not\\n  necessarily central significance, the officials said.\\n      The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took\\n  place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement\\n  simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\\n  Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\\n      \"You have to look at the dollar\\'s peak compared with now,\\n  and that was well before Plaza,\" he said.\\n      On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\\n  263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\\n  242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\\n  periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\\n  dollar trend has been down, down, down.\\n      Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\\n  rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\\n  European currencies are moving back up against the yen.\\n      The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\\n  flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\\n  undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\\n  changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\\n  both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\\n  This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\\n      Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\\n  of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\\n      Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\\n  pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\\n  and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\\n      \"The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\\n  tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\\n  sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\\n  to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\\n  laying the golden egg,\" said de Hora.\\n      The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\\n  in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\\n  start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\\n      The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\\n  U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\\n  imbalance, and which will cause problems.\\n      \"This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\\n  reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\\n  therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\\n  edge,\" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\\n  Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. \"If you want\\n  my objective view, I don\\'t expect a drastic improvement in our\\n  trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,\\n  and this year we may have to do so again,\" he said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

       " u'ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - DUTCH EXCHANGE RATE POLICY\\n  Recent slackness on Dutch capital\\n  markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank\\'s\\n  policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark\\n  and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.\\n      While agreeing with the Bank\\'s commitment to defend the\\n  guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use\\n  of the range within which the guilder and the mark can\\n  fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System\\n  (EMS).\\n      Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV\\n  (Amro) said the Central Bank\\'s policy was overcautious.\\n      \"I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the\\n  range given to the guilder in the EMS,\" Nelissen said at the\\n  presentation of Amro\\'s 1986 annual report last week.\\n      Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against\\n  the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.\\n      The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to\\n  keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a\\n  stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate\\n  policies to influence the exchange rate.\\n      The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate\\n  aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.\\n      Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.\\n      Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: \"By\\n  maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the\\n  expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it\\n  suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to\\n  obtain.\"\\n      Amro\\'s Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest\\n  rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of\\n  securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital\\n  market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring\\n  about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he\\n  added.\\n      Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is\\n  a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central\\n  Bank\\'s policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters,\\n  noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with\\n  the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.\\n      \"It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference\\n  between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,\" he added.\\n      Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the\\n  Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows\\n  between the two countries, as the economic performance of the\\n  two does not differ much, economists said.\\n      Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the\\n  Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they\\n  accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two\\n  countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the\\n  Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.\\n      Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest\\n  and exchange rates.\\n      West Germany is the Netherlands\\' largest single trading\\n  partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of\\n  imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of\\n  Statistics figures show.\\n      At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits\\n  trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a\\n  rate of around 5-7/16 pct.\\n      Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will\\n  even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in\\n  1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.\\n      In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to\\n  decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch\\n  Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.\\n  German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation\\n  between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.\\n      But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money\\n  dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates\\n  independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.\\n      Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22,\\n  the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5\\n  pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit\\n  surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had\\n  expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.\\n      The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact\\n  on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.\\n      While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its\\n  policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range\\n  narrow.\\n      \"The European Monetary System is not only a relationship\\n  between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the\\n  margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell\\n  large amounts of a third currency,\" Central Bank vice-director\\n  Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said.\\n      \"If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the\\n  markets would start to believe it was weak.

The consumer position would have in effect reduced the\\n  market share of Brazil, by far the world\\'s largest producer.\\n      Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support\\n  legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.\\n  customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply\\n  with any future coffee quotas.\\n      He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the\\n  coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London\\n  talks, but \"nobody is proposing we change our position.\"\\n      However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee\\n  policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market\\n  offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,\\n  to soften the consumer position.\\n      \"Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will\\n  kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and\\n  consumers,\" said one U.S. official.\\n      The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said\\n  Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few\\n  months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other\\n  countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers\\n  who differed with the major producers in London.\\n      This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin\\n  American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the\\n  U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in\\n  the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.\\n  officials said.\\n      The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee\\n  policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from\\n  politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.\\n  officials said.\\n      El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia\\n  at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on\\n  objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica\\n  joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to\\n  objective criteria.\\n      There is a strong feeling among some in the State\\n  Department that the United States should continue to support\\n  the splinter group of producers who have taken the\\n  politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective\\n  criteria question, U.S. officials said.\\n      Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be\\n  some pressure to reassess positions.\\n      In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the\\n  Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on\\n  the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.\\n      This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations\\n  to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.\\n      However, U.S. sources said West Germany\\'s support was at\\n  times qualified and there is some concern that the European\\n  Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to\\n  producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and\\n  other African producers during the talks.\\n      A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,\\n  although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.\\n      While political manuevering by small producers and\\n  consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the\\n  key to any future outcome will be Brazil\\'s position.\\n      U.S. officials blamed Brazil\\'s intransigence for the\\n  failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from\\n  Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly\\n  on foreigners,\" one portfolio manager for a large securities\\n  investment house in Frankfurt said.\\n      The sources also said the government had already stepped up\\n  its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.\\n      Friday\\'s loan stock was the third this year already, the\\n  sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six\\n  pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.\\n      This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct\\n  coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.\\n      But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract\\n  foreign investors, and the federal government would have to\\n  push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.\\n      Sources noted federal government issues had also increased\\n  in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume\\n  only starting last May.\\n      One finance ministry economist said \"It isn\\'t more. It\\'s\\n  just the size (of each bond) which has increased.\" He added\\n  conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly\\n  favourable for raising new debt.\\n      Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,\\n  with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.\\n      With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,\\n  foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as\\n  hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.\\n      Sources said the government has may have already stepped up\\n  its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.\\n      The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in\\n  1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing\\n  through bonds was 26.6 billion.\\n      The sources said this indicated a move by the government\\n  out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds\\n  through the more acceptable loan stock form.\\n      Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large\\n  amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including\\n  the government\\'s tax reduction program, would also reduce\\n  income next year. \"The problem here will be the tax reform,\" the\\n  portfolio manager said.\\n      He added that the government\\'s cut in its top income tax\\n  rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for\\n  the government to reduce borrowings.\\n      The sources said the government would fall far short of\\n  covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the\\n  tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to\\n  fall back on debt markets in one form or the other.\\n      The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal\\n  government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen\\n  back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the\\n  issue of fixed-rate medium-term \"Kassenobligation\" notes.\\n      A finance ministry economist said the government did not\\n  expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a\\n  net 22.3 billion marks this year.\\n      Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would\\n  probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come\\n  into effect.\\n      \"I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would\\n  mean government borrowing will increase,\" the manager said.\\n      Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with\\n  the Bundesbank\\'s public authority bond yield calculation\\n  falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.\\n      But sources said foreign demand for the new federal\\n  government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the\\n  dollar may now rise against the mark.\\n      \"The demand wasn\\'t so good,\" a dealer for a German bank in\\n  London said.\\n      The dollar\\'s recent slight appreciation against the mark\\n  even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds\\n  recently, some dealers said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

You\\'ll find a lot of people who think we have not\\n  done the former enough. You\\'ll find poeple who think we haven\\'t\\n  avoided violating agreements.\"\\n      In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful\\n  chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the trade\\n  subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced\\n  Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports\\n  from countries that engage in unfair trade practices.\\n      It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would\\n  hurt the U.S. economy.\\n      Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois\\n  Democrat, insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if\\n  the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law.\\n      Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a\\n  tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this\\n  year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he\\n  saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill.\\n      As an indication of his success, White House spokesman\\n  Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still\\n  did not like some provisions. But he added, \"Generally we feel\\n  very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade\\n  legislation. I think we are progressing very well.\"\\n      The first battle will take place next week when the full\\n  House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep.\\n  Richard Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, to force countries such\\n  as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses\\n  with the United States.\\n      The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only\\n  that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United\\n  States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices,\\n  but would not automatically set off retaliation.\\n      Rep.

I\\'m trying to write legislation that will be signed\\n  by the president.\"\\n      In writing the bill, the subcommittee rejected calls for\\n  trade relief for specific industries such as textiles.\\n      Rep. Ed Jenkins, a Democrat from Georgia, agreed to hold\\n  off his fight. He intends to push separately a bill to protect\\n  the domestic textile and shoe industry, an aide said. Reagan\\n  vetoed a similar measure last year.\\n      House Speaker Jim Wright, a Texas Democrat, is one of the\\n  most influential proponents of aid for specific industries\\n  beset by low priced foreign competition.\\n      Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the\\n  domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate\\n  plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports\\n  reach half of domestic consumption.\\n      For the most part, the trade bill\\'s provisions toughen U.S.\\n  enforcement of trade laws. The bill forces the administration\\n  to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as\\n  dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost\\n  of production.\\n      It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an\\n  industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its\\n  existence.

The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory\\n  financing facility and a structural adjustment facility.\\n      The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed,\\n  Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the\\n  next 12 months.\\n      Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980,\\n  opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris\\n  Club and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of\\n  Bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.\\n      Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the\\n  negotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be\\n  finalised, had been extremely successful.\\n      Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule\\n  Bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and\\n  had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.\\n      Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.\\n      Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in\\n  disbursements this year from lender countries and international\\n  agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American\\n  Development Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put\\n  the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.\\n      Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are\\n  around 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor\\n  Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985.

He said Bolivia's commercial bank\\n  steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider\\n  the proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the\\n  country's creditor banks will take up the offer.\\n      One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to\\n  buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the\\n  deal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans\\n  to the country.\\n      But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a\\n  scheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated\\n  in Chile for the past two years.\\n      The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for\\n  debt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to\\n  privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve\\n  as a basis for such a scheme.\\n      Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove\\n  attractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the\\n  government realises that it will have to attract a large amount\\n  of new capital in order to grow.\\n      Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters\\n  that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new\\n  investment over the next 10 to 12 years.\\n      The government realises that in order to remain viable,\\n  Bolivia will need to develop new exports.\\n      The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of\\n  Bolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets,\\n  and gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant\\n  supply in the region.\\n  \\n\\n\",\n",

In his budget, Lawson set\\n  no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3.\\n      Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the\\n  exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS),\\n  Lawson repeated that \"it is most unlikely we will enter before\\n  the next election.\"\\n      He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS\\n  membership under constant review. But he would not indicate\\n  what the chief considerations for this were for the government.\\n      Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a\\n  decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of\\n  the U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on\\n  other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls.\\n      Although Lawson denounced what he said was \"the current wave\\n  of election fever\" in Britain, he added:  \"It is more likely that\\n  there will be an election this year\" than not.\\n      He said he supported an early election only because it\\n  would clear the air. \"Ideally, we (the government) should have a\\n  full term,\" but events could force a premature poll, Lawson\\n  said.\\n      The government, which has been in power since 1979, must\\n  call an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either\\n  a June or an early autumn election, political sources said.\\n      The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88\\n  \"was the right balance, economically and politically,\" he said.\\n      Lawson\\'s decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate\\n  of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted\\n  that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have\\n  allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move.\\n      But it was being praised today by political analysts as a\\n  shrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not\\n  be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe\\n  the electorate.\\n      Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much\\n  the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion\\n  stg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg.\\n      Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson\\n  stressed that \"they are not an objective (for the government) -\\n  they are an instrument of policy.\" Consequently the Treasury had\\n  no precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said.\\n      But \"there may be interest rate consequences\" from changes in\\n  the level of government borrowing, he added.\\n      Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.\\'s relatively\\n  high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in\\n  Britain.\\n      He said conditions created by London\\'s role as a leading\\n  financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be\\n  higher in real terms than in other countries.\\n      Three factors had caused the higher level in relative\\n  interest rates in Britain, Lawson said.\\n      First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest\\n  rates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets.\\n      He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused\\n  by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party.\\n       Thirdly, he said \"we do not have as long a track record of\\n  low inflation\" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany.\\n      Lawson foresaw London becoming the world\\'s pre-eminent\\n  financial centre, because it was more international in\\n  character and more favourably placed in time zones than New\\n  York or Tokyo.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",

The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and\\n  still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.\\n      The administration has strongly urged that the bill be\\n  expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.\\n      It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision\\n  will emerge from the committee, the sources said.\\n      Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large\\n  estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates\\n  by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.\\n      Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this\\n  time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of\\n  the bill, committee staffers said.\\n      The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A\\n  conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and\\n  staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.\\n      Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an\\n  expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of\\n  the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup\\n  for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.\\n      Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so\\n  something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be\\n  implemented, an Agriculture Department source said.\\n      An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last\\n  week\\'s subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee\\n  chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the\\n  consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was\\n  necessary.\\n      Major commodity groups, including the National Corn\\n  Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen\\'s\\n  Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.\\n      But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill\\n  currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it\\n  should be extended to other crops.\\n      There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said\\n  Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.\\n      Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to\\n  decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the\\n  debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.\\n      Rep.

Consumers said \"objective criteria\" like average\\n  exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,\\n  Dauster said.\\n      All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but\\n  consumers insisted they did not want a return to the \"ad hoc\" way\\n  of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst\\n  producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.\\n      Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and\\n  non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and\\n  that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set\\n  ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.\\n      It is a \"simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate\"\\n  policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome\\n  to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very\\n  difficult to allocate as different \"objective criteria\" achieve\\n  different share-outs of quota, Dauster said.\\n      Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO\\n  and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.\\n      Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to\\n  accept the producers\\' offer to abandon quotas if it proves\\n  impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.\\n      \"We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to\\n  encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if\\n  supplies are needed at a later stage,\" one delegate said.\\n      Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer\\n  argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO\\n  session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse\\n  and how much producers will sink their differences should\\n  prices fall further and remain depressed.\\n      The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but\\n  both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real\\n  negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in\\n  Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.\\n      More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and\\n  politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could\\n  bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than\\n  many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during\\n  the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before\\n  October are unlikely, while Brazil\\'s Dauster noted the ICO has\\n  continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.\\n      A clear difference between the pressures already being felt\\n  by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been\\n  happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could\\n  not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could\\n  show a direct relationship between quotas and availability.\\n      In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the\\n  seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to\\n  lapse should lasting agreement not be found.\\n      \"Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their\\n  failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient\\n  and we wanted a cast iron commitment now,\" one consumer said.\\n  \\n\\n',\n",
